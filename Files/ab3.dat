AB  - We report here the near-complete genome sequence of "Candidatus Spirobacillus
      cienkowskii," a spiral-shaped, red-pigmented uncultivated bacterial pathogen of
      Daphnia spp. The genome is 2.74 Mbp in size, has a GC content of 32.1%, and
      contains genes associated with bacterial motility and the production of
      carotenoids, which could explain the distinctive red color of hosts infected with
      this pathogen.

TI  - The Fecal Metagenomics of Malayan Pangolins Identifies an Extensive Adaptation to
      Myrmecophagy.

AB  - The characteristics of flora in the intestine of an animal, including the number 
      and abundance of different microbial species and their functions, are closely
      related to the diets of the animal and affect the physical condition of the host.
      The Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) is an endangered species that specializes
      in myrmecophagy. Analyzing the microbiome in the intestine of the pangolin is
      imperative to protect this species. By sequencing the metagenomes of the feces of
      four pangolins, we constructed a non-redundant catalog of 211,868 genes
      representing 1,811 metagenomic species. Taxonomic annotation revealed that
      Bacteroidetes (49.9%), Proteobacteria (32.2%), and Firmicutes (12.6%) are the
      three main phyla. The annotation of gene functions identified 5,044 genes from 88
      different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families in the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes
      database and 114 gene modules related to chitin-degrading enzymes, corresponding 
      to the catalytic domains of GH18 family enzymes, containing chitinase genes of
      classes III and V in the dataset. Fourteen gene modules corresponded to the
      catalytic domains of GH19 family enzymes, containing chitinase genes of classes
      I, II, and IV. These genes were found in 37 species belonging to four phyla:
      Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Moreover, when the 
      metabolic pathways of these genes were summarized, 41,711 genes were associated
      with 147 unique KEGG metabolic pathways, and these genes were assigned to two
      Gene Ontology terms: metabolic process and catalytic activity. We also found
      several species that likely play roles in the digestion of cellulose and may be
      able to degrade chitin, including Enterobacter cloacae, Lactococcus lactis,
      Chitinimonas koreensis, and Chitinophaga pinensis. In addition, we identified
      some intestinal microflora and genes related to diseases in pangolins.
      Twenty-seven species were identified by STAMP analysis as differentially abundant
      in healthy and diseased animals: 20 species, including Cellulosilyticum
      lentocellum and Lactobacillus reuteri, were more abundant in healthy pangolins,
      while seven species, including Odoribacter splanchnicus, Marinilabilia
      salmonicolor, Xanthomonas citri, Xanthomonas vasicola, Oxalobacter formigenes,
      Prolixibacter bellariivorans, and Clostridium bolteae, were more abundant in
      diseased pangolins. These results will support the efforts to conserve pangolins.

TI  - The Occurrence of Putative Nitric Oxide Dismutase (Nod) in an Alpine Wetland with
      a New Dominant Subcluster and the Potential Ability for a Methane Sink.
PG  - 6201541
LID - 10.1155/2018/6201541 [doi]
AB  - Recently, a new oxygenic pathway has been proposed based on the
      disproportionation of NO with putative NO dismutase (Nod). In addition to a new
      process in nitrogen cycling, this process provides ecological advantages for the 
      degradation of substrates in anaerobic conditions, which is of great significance
      for wastewater treatment. However, the Nod distribution in aquatic environments
      is rarely investigated. In this study, we obtained the nod genes with an
      abundance of 2.38 +/- 0.96 x 10(5) copies per gram of dry soil from the Zoige
      wetland and aligned the molecular characteristics in the corresponding Nod
      sequences. These Nod sequences were not only found existing in NC10 bacteria, but
      were also found forming some other clusters with Nod sequences from a WWTP
      reactor or contaminated aquifers. Moreover, a new subcluster in the
      aquifer-similar cluster was even dominant in the Zoige wetland and was named the 
      Z-aquifer subcluster. Additionally, soils from the Zoige wetland showed a high
      potential rate (10.97 +/- 1.42 nmol of CO2 per gram of dry soil per day) for
      nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (N-DAMO) with low abundance of NC10
      bacteria, which may suggest a potential activity of Nod in other clusters when
      considering the dominance of the Z-aquifer subcluster Nod. In conclusion, we
      verified the occurrence of Nod in an alpine wetland for the first time and found 
      a new subcluster to be dominant in the Zoige wetland. Moreover, this new
      subcluster of Nod may even be active in the N-DAMO process in this alpine
      wetland, which needs further study to confirm.

PG  - 701-711

AB  - The routine therapeutic use of antibiotics has caused resistance genes to be
      disseminated across microbial populations. In particular, bacterial strains
      having antibiotic resistance genes are frequently observed in the human
      microbiome. Moreover, multidrug-resistant pathogens are now widely spread,
      threatening public health. Such genes are transferred and spread among bacteria
      even in different environments. Advances in high throughput sequencing technology
      and computational algorithms have accelerated investigation into antibiotic
      resistance genes of bacteria. Such studies have revealed that the antibiotic
      resistance genes are located close to the mobility-associated genes, which
      promotes their dissemination. An increasing level of information on genomic
      sequences of resistome should expedite research on drug-resistance in our body
      and environment, thereby contributing to the development of public health policy.
      In this review, the high prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and their
      exchange in the human and environmental microbiome is discussed with respect to
      the genomic contents. The relationships among diverse resistomes, related
      bacterial species, and the antibiotics are reviewed. In addition, recent advances
      in bioinformatics approaches to investigate such relationships are discussed.

AB  - Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) is a major insect order including important
      pollinators and agricultural pests, however their microbiomes are little studied.
      Here, using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based shotgun metagenomics, we
      characterize both the biodiversity and functional potential of gut microbiota of 
      a lepidopteran model insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori. Two metagenomes, including
      the standard inbred strain Dazao (P50) and an improved hybrid strain Qiufeng x
      Baiyu (QB) widely used in commercial silk production, were generated, containing 
      45,505,084 and 69,127,002 raw reads, respectively. Taxonomic analysis revealed
      that a total of 663 bacterial species were identified in P50 silkworms, while 322
      unique species in QB silkworms. Notably, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and
      Enterococcus were dominated in both strains. The further functional annotation
      was performed by both BlastP and MG-RAST against various databases including Nr, 
      COG, KEGG, CAZy and SignalP, which revealed >5 x 10(6) protein-coding genes.
      These datasets not only provide first insights into all bacterial genes in
      silkworm guts, but also help to generate hypotheses for subsequently testing
      functional traits of gut microbiota in an important insect group.

TI  - Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 293-305
LID - 10.1038/s41564-018-0306-4 [doi]
AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial chronic conditions of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in
      the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome-the molecular interface between
      host and microbiota-are less well understood. To address this gap, we performed
      untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool
      samples from discovery (n = 155) and validation (n = 65) cohorts of CD, UC and
      non-IBD control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly
      correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation).
      Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical 
      classes that were differentially abundant in IBD, including enrichments for
      sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and
      tetrapyrroles. While > 50% of differentially abundant metabolite features were
      uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic 'guilt
      by association' (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant
      species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to
      oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous
      findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations 
      between differentially abundant species and well-characterized differentially
      abundant metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are
      perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based
      classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of
      individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our
      findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the
      microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many
      potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

AB  - The spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), contributing to
      widespread carbapenem resistance, has become a global concern. However, the
      specific dissemination patterns of carbapenemase genes have not been intensively 
      investigated in developing countries, including Myanmar, where NDM-type
      carbapenemases are spreading in clinical settings. In the present study, we
      phenotypically and genetically characterized 91 CPE isolates obtained from
      clinical (n = 77) and environmental (n = 14) samples in Yangon, Myanmar. We
      determined the dissemination of plasmids harboring genes encoding NDM-1 and its
      variants using whole-genome sequencing and plasmid analysis. IncFII plasmids
      harboring bla NDM-5 and IncX3 plasmids harboring bla NDM-4 or bla NDM-7 were the 
      most prevalent plasmid types identified among the isolates. The IncFII plasmids
      were predominantly carried by clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, and their
      clonal expansion was observed within the same ward of a hospital. In contrast,
      the IncX3 plasmids were found in phylogenetically divergent isolates from
      clinical and environmental samples classified into nine species, suggesting
      widespread dissemination of plasmids via horizontal transfer. Half of the
      environmental isolates were found to possess IncX3 plasmids, and this type of
      plasmid was confirmed to transfer more effectively to recipient organisms at a
      relatively low temperature (25 degrees C) compared to the IncFII plasmid.
      Moreover, various other plasmid types were identified harboring bla NDM-1,
      including IncFIB, IncFII, IncL/M, and IncA/C2, among clinical isolates of
      Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter cloacae complex. Overall, our results
      highlight three distinct patterns of the dissemination of bla NDM-harboring
      plasmids among CPE isolates in Myanmar, contributing to a better understanding of
      their molecular epidemiology and dissemination in a setting of endemicity.

AB  - The impact of commonly-used livestock antibiotics on soil nitrogen
      transformations under varying redox conditions is largely unknown. Soil column
      incubations were conducted using three livestock antibiotics (monensin,
      lincomycin and sulfamethazine) to better understand the fate of the antibiotics, 
      their effect on nitrogen transformation, and their impact on soil microbial
      communities under aerobic, anoxic, and denitrifying conditions. While monensin
      was not recovered in the effluent, lincomycin and sulfamethazine concentrations
      decreased slightly during transport through the columns. Sorption, and to a
      limited extent degradation, are likely to be the primary processes leading to
      antibiotic attenuation during leaching. Antibiotics also affected microbial
      respiration and clearly impacted nitrogen transformation. The occurrence of the
      three antibiotics as a mixture, as well as the occurrence of lincomycin alone
      affected, by inhibiting any nitrite reduction, the denitrification process.
      Discontinuing antibiotics additions restored microbial denitrification.
      Metagenomic analysis indicated that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
      Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the predominant phyla observed throughout
      the study. Results suggested that episodic occurrence of antibiotics led to a
      temporal change in microbial community composition in the upper portion of the
      columns while only transient changes occurred in the lower portion. Thus, the
      occurrence of high concentrations of veterinary antibiotic residues could impact 
      nitrogen cycling in soils receiving wastewater runoff or manure applications with
      potential longer-term microbial community changes possible at higher antibiotic
      concentrations.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can induce remission in
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In a randomized controlled trial of FMT in
      patients with active UC, we aimed to identify bacterial taxonomic and functional 
      factors associated with response to therapy. METHODS: We performed a double-blind
      trial of 81 patients with active UC randomly assigned to groups that received an 
      initial colonoscopic infusion and then intensive multidonor FMT or placebo
      enemas, 5 d/wk for 8 weeks. Patients in the FMT group received blended
      homogenized stool from 3-7 unrelated donors. Patients in the placebo group were
      eligible to receive open-label FMT after the double-blind study period. We
      collected 314 fecal samples from the patients at screening, every 4 weeks during 
      treatment, and 8 weeks after the blinded or open-label FMT therapy. We also
      collected 160 large-bowel biopsy samples from the patients at study entry, at
      completion of 8 weeks of blinded therapy, and at the end of open-label FMT, if
      applicable. We analyzed 105 fecal samples from the 14 individual donors (n = 55),
      who in turn contributed to 21 multidonor batches (n = 50). Bacteria in colonic
      and fecal samples were analyzed by both 16S ribosomal RNA gene and transcript
      amplicon sequencing; 285 fecal samples were analyzed by shotgun metagenomics, and
      60 fecal samples were analyzed for metabolome features. RESULTS: FMT increased
      microbial diversity and altered composition, based on analyses of colon and fecal
      samples collected before vs after FMT. Diversity was greater in fecal and colon
      samples collected before and after FMT treatment from patients who achieved
      remission compared with patients who did not. Patients in remission after FMT had
      enrichment of Eubacterium hallii and Roseburia inulivorans compared with patients
      who did not achieve remission after FMT and had increased levels of short-chain
      fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary bile acids. Patients who did not achieve
      remission had enrichment of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Sutterella
      wadsworthensis, and Escherichia species and increased levels of heme and
      lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Bacteroides in donor stool were associated with 
      remission in patients receiving FMT, and Streptococcus species in donor stool was
      associated with no response to FMT. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of fecal and
      colonic mucosa samples from patients receiving FMT for active UC and stool
      samples from donors, we associated specific bacteria and metabolic pathways with 
      induction of remission. These findings may be of value in the design of
      microbe-based therapies for UC. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number NCT01896635.

AB  - betagalactosidases have wide industrial applications in lactose hydrolysis and
      transglycosylation reactions. Therefore, there is a need to mine novel and
      high-quality beta-galactosidases with good tolerance and novel features from
      harsh environments and genomic databases. In this study, an Escherichia coli
      beta-galactosidase-deficient host, DeltalacZ(DE3)pRARE, was constructed by the
      CRISPR-Cas9 system for screening active beta-galactosidases. Of thirty selected
      beta-galactosidases, twelve novel enzymes showed beta-galactosidase activity,
      four of which were purified for further study. BGal_375 exhibited maximal
      activity at pH 8 and 50 degrees C. The concentrations of two types of
      galactooligosaccharides, tri- and tetra-saccharides, produced by BGal_375,
      reached 64.53g/l and 8.32g/l, respectively. BGal_375 displayed a Km value of
      1.65mM and kcat value of 53 s(-1) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside
      (pNPG). BGal_137, BGal_144-3, and BGal_145-2 showed promising hydrolytic activity
      for pNPG. BGal_137 is a homodimer while BGal_144-3, BGal_145-2, and BGal_375 were
      all monomeric. This study provided an efficient solution for the identification
      of new beta-galactosidases from metagenomic data, and an alkaline
      beta-galactosidase efficient for the synthesis of galactooligosaccharides was
      obtained, which is important for potential industrial applications.

AB  - Metagenomics has emerged to isolate novel enzymes from the uncultured microbiota 
      in the environment. In this study, the metagenomic data obtained from camel rumen
      was considered as the potential source of microbial xylanase enzymes with proper 
      activity in extreme conditions. The metagenomic data were assembled and contigs
      were used for in-silico identification of candidate thermostable enzyme. A novel 
      thermostable xylanase enzyme, named PersiXyn1, with 1146bp full-length gene which
      encodes a 381 amino acid protein was identified. Using the DNA template extracted
      from camel rumen metagenomic samples, the candidate enzyme genes were cloned and 
      expressed in proper E. coli strains. The phylogenetic analysis showed the
      evolutionary position of PersiXyn1 among the known thermostable xylanases. The
      results of the CD analysis and determining the secondary structure of the enzyme,
      confirmed the presence of a high percentage of beta-sheets as an important
      characteristic of thermophilic xylanases. The PersiXyn1 was active at a broad
      range of pH (6-11) and temperature (25-90 degrees C). The optimum pH and
      temperature were 8 and 40 degrees C respectively, and the enzyme maintained 80%
      of its maximum activity in the pH8 and temperature 40 degrees C for 1h. The
      Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of enzyme treated pulp clearly
      showed that the effective use of enzymes in fiber separation may reduce the cost 
      of carton paper production. The novelty of this enzyme lies in the fact that it
      is highly active and stable in a broad range of pH and temperature. This study
      highlights the potential importance of camel microbiome for discovering novel
      thermostable enzymes with applications in agriculture and industries.

AB  - The aim was to evaluate pathogenic bacteria (PB) survival during the composting
      of chicken manure (CM) amended with five different dosages of clay compared to CM
      without clay-applied treatment. The results showed that 85-87% of PB relative
      abundances (RAs) were significantly reduced in lower dosages of applied clay (T2 
      and T3). However, the maximum survival of PB was noticed in the T6 and T5
      treatments, but most of the PB belong to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and
      Proteobacteria phylum and their derivative bacterial species. The changes in PB
      during the composting were not only strongly influenced by clay amendment but
      also significantly associated with the succession of bacterial species in
      compost. Bacillus, Clostridium, Mycobacterium and Klebsiella were the dominant
      spore-forming bacteria identified in higher dosages of clay (i.e., T4, T5 and T6)
      treatments, but very low abundance of these bacterial genus and its species were 
      recovered from lower dosages of clay (T2 and T3)-applied treatments. Overall,
      without clay, amended-CM-derived compost contained a relatively higher PB
      abundance than other treatments, as the anaerobic bacterial species
      Clostridium_difficile_AA1, Vibrio_cholerae, and Acinetobacter_calcoaceticus had
      relatively greater RAs, followed by Klebsiella_oxytoca_10-5248,
      Paenibacillus_Bacillus_cereus and Bartonella_quintana_RM-11. Thus, CM composting 
      with 4% clay amendment is considered a useful method for the efficient recycling 
      of CM, as this process produced sanitized compost with less survival of PB.

AB  - Between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, many Neolithic societies declined throughout
      western Eurasia due to a combination of factors that are still largely debated.
      Here, we report the discovery and genome reconstruction of Yersinia pestis, the
      etiological agent of plague, in Neolithic farmers in Sweden, pre-dating and basal
      to all modern and ancient known strains of this pathogen. We investigated the
      history of this strain by combining phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of 
      the bacterial genome, detailed archaeological information, and genomic analyses
      from infected individuals and hundreds of ancient human samples across Eurasia.
      These analyses revealed that multiple and independent lineages of Y. pestis
      branched and expanded across Eurasia during the Neolithic decline, spreading most
      likely through early trade networks rather than massive human migrations. Our
      results are consistent with the existence of a prehistoric plague pandemic that
      likely contributed to the decay of Neolithic populations in Europe.

AB  - Current metagenomic tools allow the recovery of microbial genomes directly from
      the environment. This can be accomplished by binning metagenomic contigs
      according to their coverage and tetranucleotide frequency, followed by an
      estimation of the bin quality. The public availability of bioinformatics tools,
      together with the decreasing cost of next generation sequencing, are
      democratizing this powerful approach that is spreading from specialized research 
      groups to the general public. Using metagenomes from hypersaline environments, as
      well as mock metagenomes composed of Archaea and Bacteria frequently found in
      these systems, we have analyzed the advantages and difficulties of the binning
      process in these extreme environments to tackle microbial population diversity.
      These extreme systems harbor relatively low species diversity but high
      intraspecific diversity, which can compromise metagenome assembly and therefore
      the whole binning process. The main goal is to compare the output of the binning 
      process with what is previously known from the analyzed samples, based on years
      of study using different approaches. Several scenarios have been analyzed in
      detail: (i) a good quality bin from a species highly abundant in the environment;
      (ii) an intermediate quality bin with incongruences that can be solved by further
      analyses and manual curation, and (iii) a low-quality bin to investigate the
      failure to recover a very abundant microbial genome as well as some possible
      solutions. The latter can be considered the "great metagenomics anomaly" and is
      mainly due to assembly problems derived from the microdiversity of naturally
      co-existing populations in nature.

TI  - Long-term colonisation with donor bacteriophages following successful faecal
      microbial transplantation.
PG  - 220
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0598-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is used in the treatment of
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Its success is typically attributed to
      the restoration of a diverse microbiota. Viruses (including bacteriophages) are
      the most numerically dominant and potentially the most diverse members of the
      microbiota, but their fate following FMT has not been well studied. RESULTS: We
      studied viral transfer following FMT from 3 donors to 14 patients. Recipient
      viromes resembled those of their donors for up to 12 months. Tracking individual 
      bacteriophage colonisation revealed that engraftment of individual bacteriophages
      was dependent on specific donor-recipient pairings. Specifically, multiple
      recipients from a single donor displayed highly individualised virus colonisation
      patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of viruses on long-term microbial dynamics is a
      factor that should be reviewed when considering FMT as a therapeutic option.

TI  - L-Fucose ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis in mice.
PG  - 344
LID - 10.1186/s12967-018-1718-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-Fucose (Fuc), a six-deoxy hexose monosaccharide, is present
      endogenously in humans and animals and has a wide range of biological functions. 
      In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of Fuc on obesity and
      hepatic steatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were
      fed a normal chow (NC) or HFD for 18 weeks to induce obesity and fatty liver. Fuc
      was administered intragastrically from the 8th week to the end of the experiment 
      (18 weeks). RESULTS: Metagenomic analysis showed that HFD altered the genomic
      profile of gut microbiota in the mice; specifically, expression of
      alpha-L-fucosidase, the gene responsible for Fuc generation, was markedly reduced
      in the HFD group compared with that in the NC group. Fuc treatment decreased body
      weight gain, fat accumulation, and hepatic triglyceride elevation in HFD-fed
      mice. In addition, Fuc decreased the levels of endotoxin-producing bacteria of
      the Desulfovibrionaceae family and restored HFD-induced enteric dysbiosis at both
      compositional and functional levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Fuc
      might be a novel strategy to treat HFD-induced obesity and fatty liver.

TI  - Mice co-administrated with partially hydrolysed whey proteins and prebiotic fibre
      mixtures show allergen-specific tolerance and a modulated gut microbiota.
PG  - 165-178
LID - 10.3920/BM2018.0001 [doi]
AB  - Non-breastfed infants at-risk of allergy are recommended to use a hydrolysed
      formula before the age of 6 months. The addition of prebiotics to this formula
      may reduce the allergy development in these infants, but clinical evidence is
      still inconclusive. This study evaluates (1) whether the exposure duration to
      different prebiotics alongside a partially hydrolysed whey protein (pHP)
      influences its' effectiveness to prevent allergy development and (2) whether the 
      gut microbiota plays a role in this process. Mice orally sensitised with whey
      and/or cholera toxin were orally treated for six days before sensitization with
      phosphate buffered saline, whey or pHP to potentially induce tolerance. Two
      groups received an oligosaccharide diet only from day -7 until -2 (GFshort and
      GFAshort) whereas two other groups received their diets from day -15 until 37
      (GFlong and GFAlong). On day 35, mice underwent an intradermal whey challenge,
      and the acute allergic skin response, shock score, and body temperatures were
      measured. At day 37, mice received whey orally and serum mouse mast cell
      protease-1, SLPI and whey-specific antibodies were assessed. Faecal samples were 
      taken at day -15, -8 and 34. Feeding mice pHP alone during tolerance induction
      did not reduce ear swelling. The tolerance inducing mechanisms seem to vary
      according to the oligosaccharide-composition. GFshort, GFlong, and GFAlong
      reduced the allergic skin response, whereas GFAshort was not potent enough.
      However, in the treatment groups, the dominant Lactobacillus species decreased,
      being replaced by Bacteroidales family S24-7 members. In addition, the relative
      abundance of Prevotella was significantly higher in the GFlong, GFAshort and
      GFAlong groups. Co-administration of oligosaccharides and pHP can induce
      immunological tolerance in mice, although tolerance induction was strongest in
      the animals that were fed oligosaccharides during the entire protocol. Some
      microbial changes coincided with tolerance induction, however, a specific
      mechanism could not be determined based on these data.

TI  - Bifidobacterium infantis M-63 improves mental health in victims with irritable
      bowel syndrome developed after a major flood disaster.
PG  - 111-120
LID - 10.3920/BM2018.0008 [doi]
AB  - Individuals in a community who developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after
      major floods have significant mental health impairment. We aimed to determine if 
      Bifidobacterium infantis M-63 was effective in improving symptoms, psychology and
      quality of life measures in flood-affected individuals with IBS and if the
      improvement was mediated by gut microbiota changes. Design was non-randomised,
      open-label, controlled before-and-after. Of 53 participants, 20 with IBS were
      given B. infantis M-63 (1x10(9) cfu/sachet/day) for three months and 33 were
      controls. IBS symptom severity scale, hospital anxiety and depression scale,
      SF-36 Questionnaire, hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth and stools for 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis were performed before and
      after intervention. 11 of 20 who were given probiotics (M-63) and 20 of 33
      controls completed study as per-protocol. Mental well-being was improved with
      M-63 vs controls for full analysis (P=0.03) and per-protocol (P=0.01)
      populations. Within-group differences were observed for anxiety and bodily pain
      (both P=0.04) in the M-63 per-protocol population. Lower ratio of
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was observed with M-63 vs controls (P=0.01) and the
      lower ratio was correlated with higher post-intervention mental score (P=0.04).
      B. infantis M-63 is probably effective in improving mental health of victims who 
      developed IBS after floods and this is maybe due to restoration of microbial
      balance and the gut-brain axis. However, our conclusion must be interpreted
      within the context of limited sample size. The study was retrospectively
      registered on 12 October 2017 and the Trial Registration Number (TRN) was
      NCT03318614.

TI  - Probiotic or synbiotic alters the gut microbiota and metabolism in a randomised
      controlled trial of weight management in overweight adults.
PG  - 121-135
LID - 10.3920/BM2018.0028 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota contributes to host energy metabolism, and altered gut
      microbiota has been associated with obesity-related metabolic disorders. We
      previously reported that a probiotic alone or together with a prebiotic controls 
      body fat mass in healthy overweight or obese individuals in a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo controlled clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01978691).
      We now aimed to investigate whether changes in the gut microbiota may be
      associated with the observed clinical benefits. Faecal and plasma samples were
      obtained from a protocol compliant subset (n=134) of participants from a larger
      clinical study where participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) into four groups: (1)
      placebo, 12 g/d microcrystalline cellulose; (2) Litesse(R) Ultra polydextrose
      (LU), 12 g/day; (3) Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420 (B420), 10(10)
      cfu/d in 12 g microcrystalline cellulose; (4) LU+B420, 1010 cfu/d of B420 in 12
      g/d LU for 6 months of intervention. The faecal microbiota composition and
      metabolites were assessed as exploratory outcomes at baseline, 2, 4, 6 months,
      and +1 month post-intervention and correlated to obesity-related clinical
      outcomes. Lactobacillus and Akkermansia were more abundant with B420 at the end
      of the intervention. LU+B420 increased Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae and
      Methanobrevibacter, while Paraprevotella was reduced. Christensenellaceae was
      consistently increased in the LU and LU+B420 groups across the intervention time 
      points, and correlated negatively to waist-hip ratio and energy intake at
      baseline, and waist-area body fat mass after 6 months treatment with LU+B420.
      Functional metagenome predictions indicated alterations in pathways related to
      cellular processes and metabolism. Plasma bile acids glycocholic acid,
      glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and taurohyodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic 
      acid were reduced in LU+B420 compared to Placebo. Consumption of B420 and its
      combination with LU resulted in alterations of the gut microbiota and its
      metabolism, and may support improved gut barrier function and obesity-related
      markers.

      for a large cattle toxicosis event.
PG  - 100003
LID - 10.1016/j.toxcx.2018.100003 [doi]
AB  - Thirty-two 14-month old steers died during a period of four days (19-23 June
      2017) after drinking from Junipers Reservoir (southeastern Oregon, USA) during a 
      cyanobacterial bloom. Clinical and histopathological findings were consistent
      with acute liver disease, and microcystin-LR was present at 3000 mug/L in a
      reservoir water sample and at 7100 mug/L in the rumen contents of one of the
      mortalities. Serum biochemistry and histological examination indicated severe
      liver damage consistent with microcystin toxicosis. Microscopic observation of
      reservoir water samples, limited to frozen or poorly stored and partially
      degraded samples, indicated the presence of abundant Anabaena/Dolichospermum, but
      the presence of other toxic cyanobacteria such as Microcystis could not be
      excluded. Metagenomic analysis showed the presence in these samples of a single
      cyanobacterium whose cpcBA, rpoB and rbcL genes indicated membership in the
      Anabaena/Dolichospermum genus. The sequence of a complete mcy gene cluster with
      homology to previously identified Anabaena mcy genes was recovered. These results
      emphasize the capacity for Anabaena/Dolichospermum blooms to produce lethal
      levels of microcystin, posing a danger to public health and livestock. Further,
      our findings indicate that such occurrences can occur outside the far-northern
      latitudes in which microcystin-producing Anabaena have typically been found.

TI  - Gut microbiota signatures in cystic fibrosis: Loss of host CFTR function drives
      the microbiota enterophenotype.
PG  - e0208171
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0208171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disorder affecting the respiratory,
      digestive, reproductive systems and sweat glands. This lethal hereditary disease 
      has known or suspected links to the dysbiosis gut microbiota. High-throughput
      meta-omics-based approaches may assist in unveiling this complex network of
      symbiosis modifications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide a
      predictive and functional model of the gut microbiota enterophenotype of
      pediatric patients affected by CF under clinical stability. METHODS: Thirty-one
      fecal samples were collected from CF patients and healthy children (HC) (age
      range, 1-6 years) and analysed using targeted-metagenomics and metabolomics to
      characterize the ecology and metabolism of CF-linked gut microbiota. The
      multidimensional data were low fused and processed by chemometric classification 
      analysis. RESULTS: The fused metagenomics and metabolomics based gut microbiota
      profile was characterized by a high abundance of Propionibacterium,
      Staphylococcus and Clostridiaceae, including Clostridium difficile, and a low
      abundance of Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium
      prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae, associated with overexpression of
      4-aminobutyrate (GABA), choline, ethanol, propylbutyrate, and pyridine and low
      levels of sarcosine, 4-methylphenol, uracil, glucose, acetate, phenol,
      benzaldehyde, and methylacetate. The CF gut microbiota pattern revealed an
      enterophenotype intrinsically linked to disease, regardless of age, and with
      dysbiosis uninduced by reduced pancreatic function and only partially related to 
      oral antibiotic administration or lung colonization/infection. CONCLUSIONS: All
      together, the results obtained suggest that the gut microbiota enterophenotypes
      of CF, together with endogenous and bacterial CF biomarkers, are direct
      expression of functional alterations at the intestinal level. Hence, it's
      possible to infer that CFTR impairment causes the gut ecosystem imbalance.This
      new understanding of CF host-gut microbiota interactions may be helpful to
      rationalize novel clinical interventions to improve the affected children's
      nutritional status and intestinal function.

TI  - Changes in the distal esophageal microbiota in Chinese patients with reflux

PG  - 18-24
LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12692 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Changes in microbiota composition in the distal esophagus may be
      associated with the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We aimed to 
      compare the composition of distal esophageal microbiota between Chinese patients 
      with reflux esophagitis (RE) and healthy volunteers using metagenomic
      high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. METHODS: Healthy
      volunteers (controls) and patients with reflux esophagitis (RE) were enrolled.
      Distal esophageal (2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction) biopsy specimens
      were obtained under endoscopy. Microbial DNA was extracted from the specimens,
      followed by 16S rDNA gene amplification and Illumina sequencing. Bioinformatic
      tools were applied to dissect the community structure. RESULTS: No dramatic
      differences in microbiota were found in RE patients compared with the controls.
      At the phylum level, only Bacteroidetes differed between the groups, being less
      abundant in the RE group. The overall number and diversity of species tended to
      be lower in RE patients, but there were no significant differences between the
      groups. Three genera, Prevotella, Helicobacter, and Moraxella, were obviously
      depleted in RE patients, as revealed by linear discriminant analysis.
      CONCLUSIONS: The composition of distal esophageal microbiota in Chinese patients 
      with RE showed moderate changes compared with healthy controls. To what extent
      these changes are associated with the pathogenesis of RE needs further
      investigation.

TI  - Imidazolium Based Ionic Liquids: A Promising Green Solvent for Water Hyacinth
      Biomass Deconstruction.
PG  - 548
LID - 10.3389/fchem.2018.00548 [doi]
AB  - Water hyacinth (WH) is a troublesome aquatic weed of natural and artificial water
      bodies of India and other tropical countries and causing severe ecological
      problems. The WH biomass is low in lignin content and contains high amount of
      cellulose and hemicellulose, making it suitable material for conversion into
      liquid fuels for energy production. This study highlighted that, how different
      imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) [1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide,
      [Cnmim]Br (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10)] with tunable properties can be employed for
      the degradation of WH biomass. Different characterizations techniques, such as
      XRD, FT-IR, SEM, and DSC are used to unravel the interplay between ILs and the
      biomass. In this study, it is observed that [Emim][Br] pretreated samples have
      maximum crystalline value (Crl = 26.38%) as compared to other ionic liquids
      pretreatments. FTIR data showed the removal of lignin from WH biomass by 12.77%
      for [Emim][Br] and 10.74% for [Edmim][Br]. SEM images have proven that [Emim][Br]
      pretreatment have altered the structure of biomass the most. Our results proved
      that IL pretreatment is a promising approach for effective treatment of WH
      biomass and causes high levels disruption of cellulose structure.

TI  - Calditol-linked membrane lipids are required for acid tolerance in Sulfolobus
      acidocaldarius.
PG  - 12932-12937
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1814048115 [doi]
AB  - Archaea have many unique physiological features of which the lipid composition of
      their cellular membranes is the most striking. Archaeal ether-linked isoprenoidal
      membranes can occur as bilayers or monolayers, possess diverse polar head groups,
      and a multiplicity of ring structures in the isoprenoidal cores. These lipid
      structures are proposed to provide protection from the extreme temperature, pH,
      salinity, and nutrient-starved conditions that many archaea inhabit. However,
      many questions remain regarding the synthesis and physiological role of some of
      the more complex archaeal lipids. In this study, we identify a radical
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius required for the 
      synthesis of a unique cyclopentyl head group, known as calditol. Calditol-linked 
      glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are membrane spanning lipids
      in which calditol is ether bonded to the glycerol backbone and whose production
      is restricted to a subset of thermoacidophilic archaea of the Sulfolobales order 
      within the Crenarchaeota phylum. Several studies have focused on the enzymatic
      mechanism for the synthesis of the calditol moiety, but to date no protein that
      catalyzes this reaction has been discovered. Phylogenetic analyses of this
      putative calditol synthase (Cds) reveal the genetic potential for calditol-GDGT
      synthesis in phyla other than the Crenarchaeota, including the Korarchaeota and
      Marsarchaeota. In addition, we identify Cds homologs in metagenomes predominantly
      from acidic ecosystems. Finally, we demonstrate that deletion of calditol
      synthesis renders S. acidocaldarius sensitive to extremely low pH, indicating
      that calditol plays a critical role in protecting archaeal cells from acidic
      stress.

TI  - Rock substrate rather than black stain alterations drives microbial community
      structure in the passage of Lascaux Cave.
PG  - 216
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0599-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World-famous UNESCO heritage from the Paleolithic human society, 
      Lascaux Cave (France), has endeavored intense microclimatic perturbations, in
      part due to high touristic pressure. These perturbations have resulted in
      numerous disturbances of the cave ecosystem, including on its microbial
      compartment, which resulted in the formation of black stains especially on the
      rock faces of the passage. We investigated the cave microbiome in this part of
      Lascaux by sampling three mineral substrates (soil, banks, and inclined planes)
      on and outside stains to assess current cave microbial assemblage and explore the
      possibility that pigmented microorganisms involved in stain development occur as 
      microbial consortia. METHODS: Microbial abundance and diversity were assessed by 
      means of quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of
      several DNA and cDNA taxonomic markers. Five sampling campaigns were carried out 
      during winter and summer to embrace potential seasonal effect in this somewhat
      stable environment (based on measurements of temperature and CO2 concentration). 
      RESULTS: While the season or type of mineral substrate did not affect the
      abundances of bacteria and micro-eukaryotes on or outside stains, mineral
      substrate rather than stain presence appears to be the most significant factor
      determining microbial diversity and structuring microbial community, regardless
      of whether DNA or cDNA markers were considered. A phylogenetic signal was also
      detected in relation to substrate types, presence of stains but not with season
      among the OTUs common to the three substrates. Co-occurrence network analyses
      showed that most bacterial and fungal interactions were positive regardless of
      the factor tested (season, substrate, or stain), but these networks varied
      according to ecological conditions and time. Microorganisms known to harbor
      pigmentation ability were well established inside but also outside black stains, 
      which may be prerequisite for subsequent stain formation. CONCLUSIONS: This first
      high throughput sequencing performed in Lascaux Cave showed that black stains
      were secondary to mineral substrate in determining microbiome community
      structure, regardless of whether total or transcriptionally active bacterial and 
      micro-eukaryotic communities were considered. These results revealed the
      potential for new stain formation and highlight the need for careful microbiome
      management to avoid further cave wall degradation.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota mediates Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea 
      in piglets.
PG  - 385
LID - 10.1186/s12917-018-1704-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes diarrhea in humans,
      cows, and pigs. The gut microbiota underlies pathology of several infectious
      diseases yet the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ETEC-induced
      diarrhea is unknown. RESULTS: By using an ETEC induced diarrheal model in piglet,
      we profiled the jejunal and fecal microbiota using metagenomics and 16S rRNA
      sequencing. A jejunal microbiota transplantation experiment was conducted to
      determine the role of the gut microbiota in ETEC-induced diarrhea. ETEC-induced
      diarrhea influenced the structure and function of gut microbiota. Diarrheal
      piglets had lower Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio and microbiota diversity in the
      jejunum and feces, and lower percentage of Prevotella in the feces, but higher
      Lactococcus in the jejunum and higher Escherichia-Shigella in the feces. The
      transplantation of the jejunal microbiota from diarrheal piglets to uninfected
      piglets leaded to diarrhea after transplantation. Microbiota transplantation
      experiments also supported the notion that dysbiosis of gut microbiota is
      involved in the immune responses in ETEC-induced diarrhea. CONCLUSION: We
      conclude that ETEC infection influences the gut microbiota and the dysbiosis of
      gut microbiota after ETEC infection mediates the immune responses in ETEC
      infection.

TI  - Bioactive Secondary Metabolites from Octocoral-Associated Microbes-New Chances
      for Blue Growth.
LID - E485 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md16120485 [doi]
AB  - Octocorals (Cnidaria, Anthozoa Octocorallia) are magnificent repositories of
      natural products with fascinating and unusual chemical structures and
      bioactivities of interest to medicine and biotechnology. However, mechanistic
      understanding of the contribution of microbial symbionts to the chemical
      diversity of octocorals is yet to be achieved. This review inventories the
      natural products so-far described for octocoral-derived bacteria and fungi,
      uncovering a true chemical arsenal of terpenes, steroids, alkaloids, and
      polyketides with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antifouling, anticancer,
      anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial activities of enormous potential for blue
      growth. Genome mining of 15 bacterial associates (spanning 12 genera) cultivated 
      from Eunicella spp. resulted in the identification of 440 putative and
      classifiable secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), encompassing
      varied terpene-, polyketide-, bacteriocin-, and nonribosomal peptide-synthase
      BGCs. This points towards a widespread yet uncharted capacity of
      octocoral-associated bacteria to synthetize a broad range of natural products.
      However, to extend our knowledge and foster the near-future laboratory production
      of bioactive compounds from (cultivatable and currently uncultivatable) octocoral
      symbionts, optimal blending between targeted metagenomics, DNA recombinant
      technologies, improved symbiont cultivation, functional genomics, and analytical 
      chemistry are required. Such a multidisciplinary undertaking is key to achieving 
      a sustainable response to the urgent industrial demand for novel drugs and enzyme
      varieties.

TI  - Metagenomic Virome Sequencing in Living Donor and Recipient Kidney Transplant
      Pairs Revealed JC Polyomavirus Transmission.
PG  - 987-994
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciy1018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Before kidney transplantation, donors and recipients are routinely
      screened for viral pathogens using specific tests. Little is known about
      unrecognized viruses of the urinary tract that potentially result in
      transmission. Using an open metagenomic approach, we aimed to comprehensively
      assess virus transmission in living-donor kidney transplantation. METHODS: Living
      kidney donors and their corresponding recipients were enrolled at the time of
      transplantation. Follow-up study visits for recipients were scheduled 4-6 weeks
      and 1 year thereafter. At each visit, plasma and urine samples were collected and
      transplant recipients were evaluated for signs of infection or other
      transplant-related complications. For metagenomic analysis, samples were enriched
      for viruses, amplified by anchored random polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
      sequenced using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. Viruses detected by
      sequencing were confirmed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 30
      living kidney donor and recipient pairs, with a follow-up of at least 1 year. In 
      addition to viruses commonly detected during routine post-transplant virus
      monitoring, metagenomic sequencing detected JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) in the urine 
      of 7 donors and their corresponding recipients. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed
      infection with the donor strain in 6 cases, suggesting transmission from the
      transplant donor to the recipient, despite recipient seropositivity for JCPyV at 
      the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic sequencing identified
      frequent transmission of JCPyV from kidney transplant donors to recipients.
      Considering the high incidence rate, future studies within larger cohorts are
      needed to define the relevance of JCPyV infection and the donor's virome for
      transplant outcomes.

      in wild environments.
PG  - 206-214

AB  - The species of the genus Saccharomyces are commonly inhabiting tree bark and the 
      surrounding soil, but their abundance have likely been underestimated due to
      biases in culturing methods. Metagenomic studies have so far been unable to
      detect Saccharomyces species in wild environments. Here, we sequenced the
      mycobiome of soils surrounding different trees at various altitudes in the
      Italian Alps. To survey for yeasts species belonging to Saccharomyces genus
      rather than other fungal species, we performed a selectivity step involving the
      isolation of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region that is specific to
      this yeast group. Reads mapping to Saccharomyces species were detected in all
      soil samples, including reads for S. mikatae and for S. eubayanus. ITS1 alignment
      of the S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and S. kudriavzevii sequences showed up to
      three base pair polymorphisms with other known strains, indicating possible new
      lineages. Basidiomycetous fungi were still the dominant species, compared to the 
      Ascomycota, but the selectivity step allowed for the first time the detection and
      study of the biodiversity of the Saccharomyces species in their natural
      environment.

TI  - Population-specific dynamics and selection patterns of transposable element
      insertions in European natural populations.
PG  - 1506-1522
LID - 10.1111/mec.14963 [doi]
AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous sequences in genomes of virtually all 
      species. While TEs have been investigated for several decades, only recently we
      have the opportunity to study their genome-wide population dynamics. Most of the 
      studies so far have been restricted either to the analysis of the insertions
      annotated in the reference genome or to the analysis of a limited number of
      populations. Taking advantage of the European Drosophila population genomics
      consortium (DrosEU) sequencing data set, we have identified and measured the
      dynamics of TEs in a large sample of European Drosophila melanogaster natural
      populations. We showed that the mobilome landscape is population-specific and
      highly diverse depending on the TE family. In contrast with previous studies
      based on SNP variants, no geographical structure was observed for TE abundance or
      TE divergence in European populations. We further identified de novo individual
      insertions using two available programs and, as expected, most of the insertions 
      were present at low frequencies. Nevertheless, we identified a subset of TEs
      present at high frequencies and located in genomic regions with a high
      recombination rate. These TEs are candidates for being the target of positive
      selection, although neutral processes should be discarded before reaching any
      conclusion on the type of selection acting on them. Finally, parallel patterns of
      association between the frequency of TE insertions and several geographical and
      temporal variables were found between European and North American populations,
      suggesting that TEs can be potentially implicated in the adaptation of
      populations across continents.

TI  - Endophytic bacterial communities of Jingbai Pear trees in north China analyzed

AB  - Plant endophytes play a crucial role in plant growth, health and ecological
      function. Jingbai pear (the best quality cultivar of Pyrus ussuriensi Maxim. ex
      Rupr.) has important ecological and economic value in north China. Conversation
      of its genetics has great meanings to pear genus (Pyrus L.). However, the
      bacterial community associated with the cultivar remains unknown. In this study, 
      the structure of endophytic bacterial communities associated with different
      tissues and soil of Jingbai Pear trees was analyzed with Illumina Miseq
      sequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA. This is the first report on bacterial
      microbiome associated with Jingbai pear. Our results demonstrated that different 
      tissues harbored a unique bacterial assemblage. Interestingly, Cyanobacteria was 
      the most abundant phylum, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Samples 
      from three different sites (soils) had significant differences in microbial
      communities structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the bacterial
      community structure correlated significantly with soil properties-temperature,
      pH, nitrogen and carbon contents. The conclusion could facilitate to understand
      the interaction and ecological function of endophytic bacteria with host Jingbai 
      pear trees, so as to benefit the pear variety genetic resource conservation and
      protection.

TI  - Metatranscriptomic and Thermodynamic Insights into Medium-Chain Fatty Acid
      Production Using an Anaerobic Microbiome.
LID - e00221-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00221-18 [doi]
AB  - Biomanufacturing from renewable feedstocks can offset fossil fuel-based chemical 
      production. One potential biomanufacturing strategy is production of medium-chain
      fatty acids (MCFA) from organic feedstocks using either pure cultures or
      microbiomes. While the set of microbes in a microbiome can often metabolize
      organic materials of greater diversity than a single species can and while the
      role of specific species may be known, knowledge of the carbon and energy flow
      within and between organisms in MCFA-producing microbiomes is only now starting
      to emerge. Here, we integrated metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and thermodynamic
      analyses to predict and characterize the metabolic network of an anaerobic
      microbiome producing MCFA from organic matter derived from lignocellulosic
      ethanol fermentation conversion residue. A total of 37 high-quality (>80%
      complete, <10% contamination) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered 
      from the microbiome, and metabolic reconstruction of the 10 most abundant MAGs
      was performed. Metabolic reconstruction combined with metatranscriptomic analysis
      predicted that organisms affiliated with Lactobacillus and Coriobacteriaceae
      would degrade carbohydrates and ferment sugars to lactate and acetate.
      Lachnospiraceae- and Eubacteriaceae-affiliated organisms were predicted to
      transform these fermentation products to MCFA. Thermodynamic analyses identified 
      conditions under which H2 is expected to be either produced or consumed,
      suggesting a potential role of H2 partial pressure in MCFA production. From an
      integrated systems analysis perspective, we propose that MCFA production could be
      improved if microbiomes were engineered to use homofermentative instead of
      heterofermentative Lactobacillus and if MCFA-producing organisms were engineered 
      to preferentially use a thioesterase instead of a coenzyme A (CoA) transferase as
      the terminal enzyme in reverse beta-oxidation. IMPORTANCE Mixed communities of
      microbes play important roles in health, the environment, agriculture, and
      biotechnology. While tapping the combined activities of organisms within
      microbiomes may allow the utilization of a wider range of substrates in
      preference to the use of pure cultures for biomanufacturing, harnessing the
      metabolism of these mixed cultures remains a major challenge. Here, we predicted 
      metabolic functions of bacteria in a microbiome that produces medium-chain fatty 
      acids from a renewable feedstock. Our findings lay the foundation for efforts to 
      begin addressing how to engineer and control microbiomes for improved
      biomanufacturing, how to build synthetic mixtures of microbes that produce
      valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and how to better understand the
      microbial communities that contribute to health, agriculture, and the
      environment.

AB  - Camuy River Cave Park (CRCP) is an underground cave system located at the
      subtropical karst carved by the Camuy River in the subtropical moist forest of
      northern Puerto Rico (Nieves-Rivera, 2003) [1]. This article contains a
      metagenomic dataset from the microbial and functional diversity of Clara Cave and
      Empalme Sinkhole water samples. The environmental DNA (eDNA) from the samples was
      extracted following direct Metagenomic DNA Isolation method, followed by
      Next-Generation-Sequencing technology (Illumina MiSeq). The sequences were
      submitted to MG-RAST online server for taxonomic profile generation and
      functional in silico description of the samples. The data consisted of domain
      Bacteria (96.69%), followed up by Viruses (2.87%), Eukaryotes (0.37%), and
      Archaea (0.02%). The data distribution by phyla showed Proteobacteria (92.61%),
      Bacteroidetes (1.66%), Actinobacteria (1.12%), and Firmicutes (0.48%). The
      subsystem functional data showed that 12.97% of genes were related to
      clustering-based subsystems, 11.40% to carbohydrates, and 11.0% to amino acids
      and derivatives. The metagenome dataset generated will provide an understanding
      and comparison framework of the microbial composition and functional diversity
      present in caves.

TI  - Effects of Probiotic Supplementation on the Gut Microbiota and Antibiotic
      Resistome Development in Preterm Infants.
PG  - 347
LID - 10.3389/fped.2018.00347 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: In 2014 probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus acidophilus and
      Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis; Infloran()) was introduced as
      standard of care to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in extremely preterm 
      infants in Norway. We aimed to evaluate the influence of probiotics and
      antibiotic therapy on the developing gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome in
      extremely preterm infants, and to compare with very preterm infants and term
      infants not given probiotics. Study design: A prospective, observational
      multicenter study in six tertiary-care neonatal units. We enrolled 76 infants; 31
      probiotic-supplemented extremely preterm infants <28 weeks gestation, 35 very
      preterm infants 28-31 weeks gestation not given probiotics and 10 healthy
      full-term control infants. Taxonomic composition and collection of antibiotic
      resistance genes (resistome) in fecal samples, collected at 7 and 28 days and 4
      months age, were analyzed using shotgun-metagenome sequencing. Results: Median
      (IQR) birth weight was 835 (680-945) g and 1,290 (1,150-1,445) g in preterm
      infants exposed and not exposed to probiotics, respectively. Two extremely
      preterm infants receiving probiotic developed NEC requiring surgery. At 7 days of
      age we found higher median relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in probiotic
      supplemented infants (64.7%) compared to non-supplemented preterm infants (0.0%) 
      and term control infants (43.9%). Lactobacillus was only detected in small
      amounts in all groups, but the relative abundance increased up to 4 months.
      Extremely preterm infants receiving probiotics had also much higher antibiotic
      exposure, still overall microbial diversity and resistome was not different than 
      in more mature infants at 4 weeks and 4 months. Conclusion: Probiotic
      supplementation may induce colonization resistance and alleviate harmful effects 
      of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. Clinical Trial

LID - 10.1080/02664763.2018.1426741 [doi]
AB  - By sequence homology search, the list of all the functions found and the counts
      of reads being aligned to them present the functional profile of a metagenomic
      sample. However, a significant obstacle has been observed in this approach due to
      the short read length associated with many next generation sequencing
      technologies. This includes artificial families, cross-annotations, length bias
      and conservation bias. The widely applied cutoff methods, such as BLAST E-value, 
      are not able to solve the problems. Following the published successful procedures
      on the artificial families and the cross-annotation issue, we propose in this
      paper to use zero-truncated Poisson and Binomial (ZTP-Bin) hierarchical modelling
      to correct the length bias and the conservation bias. Goodness-of-fit of the
      modelling and cross-validation for the prediction using a bioinformatic simulated
      sample show the validity of this approach. Evaluated on an in vitro-simulated
      data set, the proposed modelling method outperforms other traditional methods.
      All three steps were then sequentially applied on real-life metagenomic samples
      to show that the proposed framework will lead to a more accurate functional
      profile of a short read metagenomic sample.

AB  - The rate of caesarean section delivery (CSD) is increasing worldwide. It remains 
      unclear whether disruption of mother-to-neonate transmission of microbiota
      through CSD occurs and whether it affects human physiology. Here we perform
      metagenomic analysis of earliest gut microbial community structures and
      functions. We identify differences in encoded functions between microbiomes of
      vaginally delivered (VD) and CSD neonates. Several functional pathways are
      over-represented in VD neonates, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis.
      We link these enriched functions to individual-specific strains, which are
      transmitted from mothers to neonates in case of VD. The stimulation of primary
      human immune cells with LPS isolated from early stool samples of VD neonates
      results in higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 18
      (IL-18). Accordingly, the observed levels of TNF-alpha and IL-18 in neonatal
      blood plasma are higher after VD. Taken together, our results support that CSD
      disrupts mother-to-neonate transmission of specific microbial strains, linked
      functional repertoires and immune-stimulatory potential during a critical window 
      for neonatal immune system priming.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-35578-y [doi]
AB  - Generally, plant roots shape the rhizosphere fungal community but how individual 
      plant genes involved in senescence affect this shaping is less studied. We used
      an early senescence leaf (esl) mutant rice and compared it with its isogenic wild
      type variety to evaluate the effect of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (VHA-A1) gene
      mutation on the rhizosphere fungal community structure and composition using a
      metagenomic pyrosequencing approach. The most predominate fungal phyla identified
      for both isogenic lines belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota, 
      where Ascomycota were more prevalent in the esl mutant than the wild type
      variety. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed a significant rise in the 
      richness of Cladosporium cladosporioides in esl mutant rice than the wild type
      variety. Correlation analysis revealed four most abundant genera identified for
      the esl mutant and their close association with yield and biomass decline, lipid 
      peroxidation, lower root vitality, chlorophyll degradation and limited VHA
      activity. Higher K(+) efflux, H(+) and a lower Ca(2+) influx was also observed in
      the esl mutant which could be the reason for abnormal functioning of mutant
      plants. These results illustrate that besides the well-known effect of senescence
      on plant physiology and yield decline, it can further shape the rhizosphere
      fungal community.

TI  - Eelgrass Sediment Microbiome as a Nitrous Oxide Sink in Brackish Lake Akkeshi,
      Japan.

LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME18103 [doi]
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas; however, limited information is
      currently available on the microbiomes involved in its sink and source in
      seagrass meadow sediments. Using laboratory incubations, a quantitative PCR
      (qPCR) analysis of N2O reductase (nosZ) and ammonia monooxygenase subunit A
      (amoA) genes, and a metagenome analysis based on the nosZ gene, we investigated
      the abundance of N2O-reducing microorganisms and ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes as
      well as the community compositions of N2O-reducing microorganisms in in situ and 
      cultivated sediments in the non-eelgrass and eelgrass zones of Lake Akkeshi,
      Japan. Laboratory incubations showed that N2O was reduced by eelgrass sediments
      and emitted by non-eelgrass sediments. qPCR analyses revealed that the abundance 
      of nosZ gene clade II in both sediments before and after the incubation as higher
      in the eelgrass zone than in the non-eelgrass zone. In contrast, the abundance of
      ammonia-oxidizing archaeal amoA genes increased after incubations in the
      non-eelgrass zone only. Metagenome analyses of nosZ genes revealed that the
      lineages Dechloromonas-Magnetospirillum-Thiocapsa and Bacteroidetes
      (Flavobacteriia) within nosZ gene clade II were the main populations in the
      N2O-reducing microbiome in the in situ sediments of eelgrass zones.
      Sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria within nosZ gene clade II dominated in the
      lineage Dechloromonas-Magnetospirillum-Thiocapsa. Alphaproteobacteria within nosZ
      gene clade I were predominant in both zones. The proportions of
      Epsilonproteobacteria within nosZ gene clade II increased after incubations in
      the eelgrass zone microcosm supplemented with N2O only. Collectively, these
      results suggest that the N2O-reducing microbiome in eelgrass meadows is largely
      responsible for coastal N2O mitigation.

TI  - Microbial Organic Matter Degradation Potential in Baltic Sea Sediments Is
      Influenced by Depositional Conditions and In Situ Geochemistry.
LID - e02164-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02164-18 [doi]
AB  - Globally, marine sediments are a vast repository of organic matter, which is
      degraded through various microbial pathways, including polymer hydrolysis and
      monomer fermentation. The sources, abundances, and quality (i.e., labile or
      recalcitrant) of the organic matter and the composition of the microbial
      assemblages vary between sediments. Here, we examine new and previously published
      sediment metagenomes from the Baltic Sea and the nearby Kattegat region to
      determine connections between geochemistry and the community potential to degrade
      organic carbon. Diverse organic matter hydrolysis encoding genes were present in 
      sediments between 0.25 and 67 meters below seafloor and were in higher relative
      abundances in those sediments that contained more organic matter. New analysis of
      previously published metatranscriptomes demonstrated that many of these genes
      were transcribed in two organic-rich Holocene sediments. Some of the variation in
      deduced pathways in the metagenomes correlated with carbon content and
      depositional conditions. Fermentation-related genes were found in all samples and
      encoded multiple fermentation pathways. Notably, genes involved in alcohol
      metabolism were amongst the most abundant of these genes, indicating that this is
      an important but underappreciated aspect of sediment carbon cycling. This study
      is a step towards a more complete understanding of microbial food webs and the
      impacts of depositional facies on present sedimentary microbial
      communities.IMPORTANCE Sediments sequester organic matter over geologic time
      scales and impact global climate regulation. Microbial communities in marine
      sediments drive organic matter degradation, but the factors controlling their
      assemblages and activities, which in turn impact their role in organic matter
      degradation, are not well understood. Hence, determining the role of microbial
      communities in carbon cycling in various sediment types is necessary for
      predicting future sediment carbon cycling. We examined microbial communities in
      Baltic Sea sediments, which were deposited across various climatic and
      geographical regimes to determine the relationship between microbial potential
      for breakdown of organic matter and abiotic factors, including geochemistry and
      sediment lithology. The findings from this study will contribute to our
      understanding of carbon cycling in the deep biosphere and how microbial
      communities live in deeply buried environments.

TI  - Fiber-associated spirochetes are major agents of hemicellulose degradation in the
      hindgut of wood-feeding higher termites.
PG  - E11996-E12004
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1810550115 [doi]
AB  - Symbiotic digestion of lignocellulose in wood-feeding higher termites (family
      Termitidae) is a two-step process that involves endogenous host cellulases
      secreted in the midgut and a dense bacterial community in the hindgut
      compartment. The genomes of the bacterial gut microbiota encode diverse
      cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes, but the contributions of host and
      bacterial symbionts to lignocellulose degradation remain ambiguous. Our previous 
      studies of Nasutitermes spp. documented that the wood fibers in the hindgut
      paunch are consistently colonized not only by uncultured members of
      Fibrobacteres, which have been implicated in cellulose degradation, but also by
      unique lineages of Spirochaetes. Here, we demonstrate that the degradation of
      xylan, the major component of hemicellulose, is restricted to the hindgut
      compartment, where it is preferentially hydrolyzed over cellulose.
      Metatranscriptomic analysis documented that the majority of glycoside hydrolase
      (GH) transcripts expressed by the fiber-associated bacterial community belong to 
      family GH11, which consists exclusively of xylanases. The substrate specificity
      was further confirmed by heterologous expression of the gene encoding the
      predominant homolog. Although the most abundant transcripts of GH11 in
      Nasutitermes takasagoensis were phylogenetically placed among their homologs of
      Firmicutes, immunofluorescence microscopy, compositional binning of metagenomics 
      contigs, and the genomic context of the homologs indicated that they are encoded 
      by Spirochaetes and were most likely obtained by horizontal gene transfer among
      the intestinal microbiota. The major role of spirochetes in xylan degradation is 
      unprecedented and assigns the fiber-associated Treponema clades in the hindgut of
      wood-feeding higher termites a prominent part in the breakdown of hemicelluloses.

AB  - Ballast water is a common vector for the transport of invasive species to new
      marine and aquatic environments. We used a metagenomics approach to examine the
      composition and diversity of viral communities in ballast water from ships
      originating in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, New York, and Panama, and in water from the 
      port of their destination in Busan, Korea. Myoviridae was the most abundant virus
      family in ballast water, followed Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. We also
      identified viruses that infect invertebrates, amoebas, and algae in ballast water
      and in the Busan port water. Interestingly, there were several viruses that
      infect humans or other animals (Swinepox virus, Raccoonpox virus, Suid
      herpesvirus, and Human endogenous retrovirus) in the samples from New York and
      Panama. In addition, there were giant viruses in all the ballast water samples,
      especially, identified Megavirus chilensis in New York and Panama, and
      Pandoravirus salinus in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. These results provide detailed
      descriptions of the characteristics of the viruses present in ballast water,
      document significant viral diversity, and indicate the potential translocation of
      viruses via ballast water.

AB  - Microbial species thrive in very diverse environments and play fundamental roles 
      in their equilibrium and dynamics. Metagenomics consists in extracting,
      sequencing, and studying the DNA present in ecosystems to better understand their
      regulation. Ideally, the maximal amount of information would be gathered from the
      full sequences of the genomes, episomes, and phages present in the microbial
      communities. Current high-throughput DNA sequencing produces reads ranging in
      size from a few dozen base pairs for the most commonly used technologies to
      several kb for emerging single-molecule real-time sequencing techniques. Although
      valuable information can be extracted from processing these DNA sequences into
      contigs, reconstructing full genomes remains a difficult task. Clustering contigs
      according to their similarities or read coverage covariations gives some insights
      on these genomes, but remains limited as viral sequences, or recent horizontal
      gene transfers, often differ from their host genomes. We recently developed
      meta3C, a proximity ligation approach that bins contigs in a sequence-independent
      way by quantifying and exploiting their tridimensional collisions frequencies in 
      vivo. This technique has demonstrated a great potential to reconstruct genomes as
      well as to assign plasmids and phages to their hosts. It nevertheless requires a 
      specific processing of the microbial samples before sequencing, which has to be
      carefully planned.

AB  - When analyzing microbial communities, an active and computational challenge
      concerns the categorization of 16S rRNA gene sequences into operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs). Established clustering tools use a one pass algorithm to tackle
      high number of gene sequences and produce OTUs in reasonable time. However, all
      of the current tools are based on a crisp clustering approach, where a gene
      sequence is assigned to one cluster. The weak quality of the output compared with
      more complex clustering algorithms forces the user to postprocess the obtained
      OTUs. Providing a membership degree when assigning a gene sequence to an OTU will
      help the user during the postprocessing task. Moreover it is possible to use this
      membership degree to automatically evaluate the quality of the obtained OTUs. So 
      the goal of this study is to propose a new clustering approach that takes into
      account uncertainty when producing OTUs, and improves both the quality and the
      presentation of the OTU results.

TI  - Genomic and transcriptomic insights into the ecology and metabolism of benthic
      archaeal cosmopolitan, Thermoprofundales (MBG-D archaea).
PG  - 885-901
LID - 10.1038/s41396-018-0321-8 [doi]
AB  - Marine Benthic Group D (MBG-D) archaea, discovered by 16S rRNA gene survey
      decades ago, are ecologically important, yet understudied and uncultured
      sedimentary archaea. In this study, a comprehensive meta-analysis based on the
      16S rRNA genes of MBG-D archaea showed that MBG-D archaea are one of the most
      frequently found archaeal lineages in global sediment with widespread
      distribution and high abundance, including 16 subgroups in total. Interestingly, 
      some subgroups show significant segregations toward salinity and methane seeps.
      Co-occurrence analyses indicate significant non-random association of MBG-D
      archaea with Lokiarchaeota (in both saline and freshwater sediments) and
      Hadesarchaea, suggesting potential interactions among these archaeal groups.
      Meanwhile, based on four nearly complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 
      corresponding metatranscriptomes reconstructed from mangrove and intertidal
      mudflat sediments, we provide insights on metabolic potentials and ecological
      functions of MBG-D archaea. MBG-D archaea appear to be capable of transporting
      and assimilating peptides and generating acetate and ethanol through
      fermentation. Metatranscriptomic analysis suggests high expression of genes for
      acetate and amino acid utilization and for peptidases, especially the M09B-type
      extracellular peptidase (collagenase) showing high expression levels in all four 
      mangrove MAGs. Beyond heterotrophic central carbon metabolism, the MBG-D genomes 
      include genes that might encode two autotrophic pathways: Wood-Ljundahl (WL)
      pathways using both H4MPT and H4folate as C1 carriers, and an incomplete
      dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle with alternative bypasses from pyruvate to 
      malate/oxaloacetate during dicarboxylation. These findings reveal MBG-D archaea
      as an important ubiquitous benthic sedimentary archaeal group with specific
      mixotrophic metabolisms, so we proposed the name Thermoprofundales as a new Order
      within the Class Thermoplasmata. Globally, Thermoprofundales and other benthic
      archaea might synergistically transform benthic organic matter, possibly playing 
      a vital role in sedimentary carbon cycle.

TI  - Rhizosheath microbial community assembly of sympatric desert speargrasses is
      independent of the plant host.
PG  - 215
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0597-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rhizosheath-root system is an adaptive trait of sandy-desert
      speargrasses in response to unfavourable moisture and nutritional conditions.
      Under the deserts' polyextreme conditions, plants interact with edaphic
      microorganisms that positively affect their fitness and resistance. However, the 
      trophic simplicity and environmental harshness of desert ecosystems have
      previously been shown to strongly influence soil microbial community assembly. We
      hypothesize that sand-driven ecological filtering constrains the microbial
      recruitment processes in the speargrass rhizosheath-root niche, prevailing over
      the plant-induced selection. METHODS: Bacterial and fungal communities from the
      rhizosheath-root compartments (endosphere root tissues, rhizosheath and
      rhizosphere) of three Namib Desert speargrass species (Stipagrostis sabulicola,
      S. seelyae and Cladoraphis spinosa) along with bulk sand have been studied to
      test our hypothesis. To minimize the variability determined by edaphic and
      climatic factors, plants living in a single dune were studied. We assessed the
      role of plant species vs the sandy substrate on the recruitment and selection,
      phylogenetic diversity and co-occurrence microbial networks of the
      rhizosheath-root system microbial communities. RESULTS: Microorganisms associated
      with the speargrass rhizosheath-root system were recruited from the surrounding
      bulk sand population and were significantly enriched in the rhizosheath
      compartments (10(5) and 10(4) of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS copies per
      gram of sand to up to 10(8) and 10(7) copies per gram, respectively).
      Furthermore, each rhizosheath-root system compartment hosted a specific microbial
      community demonstrating strong niche-partitioning. The rhizosheath-root systems
      of the three speargrass species studied were dominated by desert-adapted
      Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (e.g. Lechevalieria, Streptomyces and
      Microvirga) as well as saprophytic Ascomycota fungi (e.g. Curvularia, Aspergillus
      and Thielavia). Our results clearly showed a random phylogenetic turnover of
      rhizosheath-root system associated microbial communities, independent of the
      plant species, where stochastic factors drive neutral assembly. Co-occurrence
      network analyses also indicated that the bacterial and fungal community members
      of the rhizosheath-root systems established a higher number of interactions than 
      those in the barren bulk sand, suggesting that the former are more stable and
      functional than the latter. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the
      rhizosheath-root system microbial communities of desert dune speargrasses are
      stochastically assembled and host-independent. This finding supports the concept 
      that the selection determined by the desert sand prevails over that imposed by
      the genotype of the different plant species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted in 
      four African countries (Madagascar, Niger, Central African Republic, and Senegal)
      is to compare three strategies of renutrition for moderate acute malnutrition
      (MAM) in children based on modulation of the gut microbiota with enriched flours 
      alone, enriched flours with prebiotics or enriched flours coupled with antibiotic
      treatment. METHODS: To be included, children aged between 6 months and 2 years
      are preselected based on mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) and are included
      based on a weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) between - 3 and - 2 standard
      deviations (SD). As per current protocols, children receive renutrition treatment
      for 12 weeks and are assessed weekly to determine improvement. The primary
      endpoint is recovery, defined by a WHZ >/= - 1.5 SD after 12 weeks of treatment. 
      Data collected include clinical and socioeconomic characteristics, side effects, 
      compliance and tolerance to interventions. Metagenomic analysis of gut microbiota
      is conducted at inclusion, 3 months, and 6 months. The cognitive development of
      children is evaluated in Senegal using only the Developmental Milestones
      Checklist II (DMC II) questionnaire at inclusion and at 3, 6, and 9 months. The
      data will be correlated with renutrition efficacy and metagenomic data.
      DISCUSSION: This study will provide new insights for the treatment of MAM, as
      well as original data on the modulation of gut microbiota during the renutrition 
      process to support (or not) the microbiota hypothesis of malnutrition. TRIAL

TI  - What Is the Giant Wall Gecko Having for Dinner? Conservation Genetics for Guiding
      Reserve Management in Cabo Verde.
LID - E599 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes9120599 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge on diet composition of a species is an important step to unveil its
      ecology and guide conservation actions. This is especially important for species 
      that inhabit remote areas within biodiversity hotspots, with little information
      about their ecological roles. The emblematic giant wall gecko of Cabo Verde,
      Tarentola gigas, is restricted to the uninhabited Branco and Raso islets, and
      presents two subspecies. It is classified as Endangered, and locally Extinct on
      Santa Luzia Island; however, little information is known about its diet and
      behaviour. In this study, we identified the main plant, arthropods, and
      vertebrates consumed by both gecko subspecies using next generation sequencing
      (NGS) (metabarcoding of faecal pellets), and compared them with the species known
      to occur on Santa Luzia. Results showed that plants have a significant role as
      diet items and identified vertebrate and invertebrate taxa with higher taxonomic 
      resolution than traditional methods. With this study, we now have data on the
      diet of both subspecies for evaluating the reintroduction of this threatened
      gecko on Santa Luzia as potentially successful, considering the generalist
      character of both populations. The information revealed by these ecological
      networks is important for the development of conservation plans by governmental
      authorities, and reinforces the essential and commonly neglected role of reptiles
      on island systems.

TI  - The Challenges of Analysing Highly Diverse Picobirnavirus Sequence Data.
LID - E685 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v10120685 [doi]
AB  - The reliable identification and classification of infectious diseases is critical
      for understanding their biology and controlling their impact. Recent advances in 
      sequencing technology have allowed insight into the remarkable diversity of the
      virosphere, of which a large component remains undiscovered. For these emerging
      or undescribed viruses, the process of classifying unknown sequences is heavily
      reliant on existing nucleotide sequence information in public databases. However,
      due to the enormous diversity of viruses, and past focus on the most prevalent
      and impactful virus types, databases are often incomplete. Picobirnaviridae is a 
      dsRNA virus family with broad host and geographic range, but with relatively
      little sequence information in public databases. The family contains one genus,
      Picobirnavirus, which may be associated with gastric illness in humans and
      animals. Little further information is available due in part to difficulties in
      identification. Here, we investigate diversity both within the genus
      Picobirnavirus and among other dsRNA virus types using a combined phylogenetic
      and functional (protein structure homology-modelling) approach. Our results show 
      that diversity within picobirnavirus exceeds that seen between many other dsRNA
      genera. Furthermore, we find that commonly used practices employed to classify
      picobirnavirus, such as analysis of short fragments and trimming of sequences,
      can influence phylogenetic conclusions. The degree of phylogenetic and functional
      divergence among picobirnavirus sequences in our study suggests an enormous
      undiscovered diversity, which contributes to the undescribed "viral dark matter" 
      component of metagenomic studies.

TI  - Oxidative stress in the oral cavity is driven by individual-specific bacterial
      communities.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1038/s41522-018-0072-3 [doi]
AB  - The term "bacterial dysbiosis" is being used quite extensively in metagenomic
      studies, however, the identification of harmful bacteria often fails due to large
      overlap between the bacterial species found in healthy volunteers and patients.
      We hypothesized that the pathogenic oral bacteria are individual-specific and
      they correlate with oxidative stress markers in saliva which reflect the
      inflammatory processes in the oral cavity. Temporally direct and lagged
      correlations between the markers and bacterial taxa were computed individually
      for 26 volunteers who provided saliva samples during one month (21.2 +/- 2.7
      samples/volunteer, 551 samples in total). The volunteers' microbiomes differed
      significantly by their composition and also by their degree of microbiome
      temporal variability and oxidative stress markers fluctuation. The results showed
      that each of the marker-taxa pairs can have negative correlations in some
      volunteers while positive in others. Streptococcus mutans, which used to be
      associated with caries before the metagenomics era, had the most prominent
      correlations with the oxidative stress markers, however, these correlations were 
      not confirmed in all volunteers. The importance of longitudinal samples
      collections in correlation studies was underlined by simulation of single sample 
      collections in 1000 different combinations which produced contradictory results. 
      In conclusion, the distinct intra-individual correlation patterns suggest that
      different bacterial consortia might be involved in the oxidative stress induction
      in each human subject. In the future, decreasing cost of DNA sequencing will
      allow to analyze multiple samples from each patient, which might help to explore 
      potential diagnostic applications and understand pathogenesis of
      microbiome-associated oral diseases.

AB  - In the present study, the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in
      laboratory-reared fresh mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor L.), their feeding
      substrates (carrots and wheatmeal), and frass was assessed. Microbial counts on
      selective media added with antibiotics highlighted the presence of lactic acid
      bacteria resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin and, more specifically,
      enterococci resistant to the latter antibiotic. Moreover, staphylococci resistant
      to gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin were detected.
      Enterobacteriaceae resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin were also found,
      together with Pseudomonadaceae resistant to gentamicin. Some of the genes coding 
      for resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) [erm(A), erm(C)], 
      vancomycin [vanA, vanB], tetracycline [tet(O)], and beta-lactams [mecA and blaZ] 
      were absent in all of the samples. For the feeding substrates, organic wheatmeal 
      was positive for tet(S) and tet(K), whereas no AR genes were detected in organic 
      carrots. The genes tet(M), tet(K), and tet(S) were detected in both mealworms and
      frass, whereas gene aac-aph, coding for resistance to amynoglicosides was
      exclusively detected in frass. No residues for any of the 64 antibiotics
      belonging to 10 different drug classes were found in either the organic wheatmeal
      or carrots. Based on the overall results, the contribution of feed to the
      occurrence of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes and/or antibiotic-resistant
      microorganisms in mealworm larvae was hypothesized together with vertical
      transmission via insect egg smearing.

TI  - Viruses control dominant bacteria colonizing the terrestrial deep biosphere after
      hydraulic fracturing.
PG  - 352-361
LID - 10.1038/s41564-018-0312-6 [doi]
AB  - The deep terrestrial biosphere harbours a substantial fraction of Earth's biomass
      and remains understudied compared with other ecosystems. Deep biosphere life
      primarily consists of bacteria and archaea, yet knowledge of their co-occurring
      viruses is poor. Here, we temporally catalogued viral diversity from five deep
      terrestrial subsurface locations (hydraulically fractured wells), examined
      virus-host interaction dynamics and experimentally assessed metabolites from cell
      lysis to better understand viral roles in this ecosystem. We uncovered high viral
      diversity, rivalling that of peatland soil ecosystems, despite low host
      diversity. Many viral operational taxonomic units were predicted to infect
      Halanaerobium, the dominant microorganism in these ecosystems. Examination of
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated
      proteins (CRISPR-Cas) spacers elucidated lineage-specific virus-host dynamics
      suggesting active in situ viral predation of Halanaerobium. These dynamics
      indicate repeated viral encounters and changing viral host range across
      temporally and geographically distinct shale formations. Laboratory experiments
      showed that prophage-induced Halanaerobium lysis releases intracellular
      metabolites that can sustain key fermentative metabolisms, supporting the
      persistence of microorganisms in this ecosystem. Together, these findings suggest
      that diverse and active viral populations play critical roles in driving
      strain-level microbial community development and resource turnover within this
      deep terrestrial subsurface ecosystem.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of captive Amur tiger faecal microbiome.
PG  - 379
LID - 10.1186/s12917-018-1696-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tracts of animals are home to large, complex
      communities of microbes. The compositions of these communities ultimately reflect
      the coevolution of microorganisms with their animal host and are influenced by
      the living environment, diet and immune status of the host. Gut microbes have
      been shown to be important for human disease and health, but little research
      exists in the gut microbiome of the Amur tiger, which is one of the most
      endangered species in the world. RESULTS: In this study, we present the use of
      whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing to analyze the composition and functional
      structures of the gut microbiota in captive Amur tigers. Our results showed a
      high abundance of four major phyla in captive Amur tigers, including
      Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria. Moreover, at the
      genus level, Escherichia, Collinsella and Fusobacterium were most abundant in the
      captive Amur tiger fecal metagenome. At the species level, Escherichia coli,
      Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium varium were the species with highest
      abundances in the captive Amur tiger gut microbiota. The primary functional
      categories of the Amur tiger faecal metagenome were associated mainly with
      Carbohydrate metabolism, Membrane transport and Amino acid metabolism based on
      the KEGG pathway database. The comparative metagenomic analyses showed that the
      captive Amur tiger fecal metagenome had a lower abundance of Spirochaetes,
      Cyanobacteria and Ascomycota than other animals, and the primary functional
      categories were primarily associated with carbohydrate metabolism subsystems,
      clustering-based subsystems and protein metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: We presented
      here for the first time the use of the shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach to
      study the composition and functional structures of the gut microbiota in captive 
      Amur tiger.

AB  - Ever-increasing production and use of nanoparticles (NPs) have aroused
      overarching concerns for their toxic effects on the environment and human. In the
      present study, the toxic effects of Silver (Ag) and Iron (Fe) NPs on the
      performance of activated sludge were investigated under continuous
      aerobic/anoxic/anaerobic conditions in laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors
      (SBRs).Activated sludge was exposed to various concentrations (5-100 mg/L) of
      Ag-Fe NPs for 60 days and its response was assessed through the enzymatic
      activity, COD, nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) removal, toxicity tests, as well
      as variations in bacterial community. Compared with the pristine control sample, 
      the exposure to NPs suppressed TN and TP removal efficiencies. Indeed, the
      respiration rate and biomass concentration were significantly affected by the
      NPs. Although the simultaneous exposure to Ag-Fe NPs did affect the integrity of 
      cell membrane (LDH) and key enzymes activities, the higher concentration induced 
      an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The metagenome analysis
      revealed a marked shift in the microbial community structure suggesting that both
      heterotrophic and autotrophic communities were affected by the presence of Ag-Fe 
      NPs. Our results provide some evidence for compounded effects of NPs in their
      simultaneous presence, and generate new leads for future research efforts.

AB  - Plastics have been accumulated offshore and in the deep oceans at an
      unprecedented scale. Microbial communities have colonized the plastisphere, which
      has become a reservoir for both antibiotic and metal resistance genes (ARGs and
      MRGs). This is the first analysis of the diversity, abundance, and co-occurrence 
      of ARGs and MRGs, and their relationships within the microbial community, using
      metagenomic data of plastic particles observed in the North Pacific Gyre obtained
      from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive
      database. The abundance of ARGs and MRGs in microbial communities on the plastics
      were in the ranges 7.07x10(-4)-1.21x10(-2) and 5.51x10(-3)-4.82x10(-2) copies per
      16S rRNA, respectively. Both the Shannon-Wiener indices and richness of ARGs and 
      MRGs in plastics microbiota were significantly greater than those of ARGs and
      MRGs in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre via one-way analysis of
      variance. Multidrug resistance genes and multi-metal resistance genes were the
      main classes of genes detected in plastic microbiota. There were no significant
      differences in the abundance or diversity of ARGs and MRGs between macroplastics 
      biota and microplastics biota, indicating that particle size had no effect on
      resistance genes. Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community
      composition was the determining factor of the ARG profile but not for MRG. Some
      ARGs and MRGs had a higher incidence of non-random co-occurrence, suggesting that
      the co-effects of selection for antibiotic or metal resistance are important
      factors influencing the resistome of the microbiota on the plastic particles.

AB  - Low intestinal microbial diversity, often leading to domination of the intestine 
      by a single organism, is associated with poor outcomes following hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT). Understanding how certain organisms achieve
      domination in the intestine is limited by current metagenomic sequencing
      technologies, which are typically unable to reconstruct complete genome drafts
      without bacterial isolation and culture. Recently, we developed a metagenomic
      read cloud sequencing approach that provides significantly improved genome drafts
      for individual organisms compared to conventional short-read sequencing methods. 
      Here, we apply read cloud sequencing to four longitudinal stool samples collected
      from an HCT patient before and after heavy antibiotic exposure. During this time 
      period, the patient experienced Escherichia coli gut domination and an E. coli
      bloodstream infection. We find that read clouds enable the placement of multiple 
      copies of antibiotic resistance genes both within and across genomes, and the
      presence of resistance genes correlates with the timing of antibiotics
      administered to the patient. Comparative genomic analysis reveals that the E.
      coli bloodstream infection likely originated from the gut. The pre-transplant E. 
      coli genome harbors 46 known resistance genes, whereas all other organisms from
      the pre-transplant time point contain 5 or fewer resistance genes, supporting a
      model in which the E. coli outgrowth was a result of selection by heavy
      antibiotic exposure. This case study highlights the application of metagenomic
      read cloud sequencing in a clinical context to elucidate the genomic
      underpinnings of microbiome dynamics under extreme selective pressures.

AB  - A denitrifying/nitrifying membrane biofilm reactor for simultaneous removal of
      Hg(0) and NO was investigated. Hg(0) and NO removal efficiency attained 94.5% and
      86%, respectively. The mercury-oxidizing microbial community was significantly
      shaped by nitrification/denitrification after the supply of gaseous Hg(0)and NO
      continuously. Dominant genera Rhodanobacter and Nitrosomonas participated in
      Hg(0) oxidation, nitrification and denitrification simultaneously. Hg(0)
      oxidizing bacteria (Gallionella, Rhodanobacter, Ottowia, Nitrosomonas and etc.), 
      nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Rhodanobacter, Diaphorobacte and etc.) and
      denitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Rhodanobacter, Castellaniella and etc.)
      co-existed in the MBfR, as shown by metagenomic sequencing. X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy (XPS) and high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled
      plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) confirmed the formation of a mercuric
      species (Hg(2+)) from mercury bio-oxidation. Mechanism of mercury oxidation can
      be described as the bacterial oxidation of Hg(0) in which Hg(0) serves as
      electron donor, NO serves as electron donor in nitrification and electron
      acceptor in denitrification, oxygen serves as electron acceptor.

AB  - Ingestion of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is inevitable linked to their
      widespread use in food, medicines and other consumer products. However, their
      effects on human microbiota at non-lethal concentrations remain poorly
      understood. In this study, the interactions among 1mugmL(-1) AgNPs, the
      intestinal microbiota, and the probiotic Bacillus subtilis (BS) were tested using
      in-vitro batch fermentation models inoculated with human fecal matter. Results
      from metagenomic investigations revealed that the core bacterial community was
      not affected by the exposure of AgNPs and BS at the later stage of fermentation, 
      while the proportions of rare species changed drastically with the treatments.
      Furthermore, shifts in the Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes (F/B) ratios were observed
      after 24h with an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes species and a 
      decrease in Bacteroidetes in all fermentation cultures. The co-exposure to AgNPs 
      and BS led to the lowest F/B ratio. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analyses
      indicated that non-lethal concentration of AgNPs negatively affected the relative
      percentage of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium 
      rectales taxa in the fermentation cultures after 24h. However, exposure to single
      and combined treatments of AgNPs and BS did not change the overall diversity of
      the fecal microflora. Functional differences in cell motility, translation,
      transport, and xenobiotics degradation occurred in AgNPs-treated fermentation
      cultures but not in AgNPs+BS-treated samples. Compared to the control samples,
      treated fecal cultures showed no significant statistical differences in terms of 
      short-chain fatty acids profiles, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on Caco-2cell
      monolayers. Overall, AgNPs did not affect the composition and diversity of the
      core fecal microflora and its metabolic and toxic profiles. This work indicated a
      chemopreventive role of probiotic on fecal microflora against AgNPs, which were
      shown by the decrease of F/B ratio and the unaltered state of some key metabolic 
      pathways.

AB  - Classical plant rhabdoviruses infect monocot and dicot plants, have unsegmented
      negative-sense RNA genomes and have been taxonomically classified in the genera
      Cytorhabdovirus and Nucleorhabdovirus. These viruses replicate in their
      hemipteran vectors and are transmitted in a circulative-propagative mode and
      virus infection persists for the life of the insect. Based on the discovery of
      numerous novel rhabdoviruses in arthropods during metagenomic studies and
      extensive phylogenetic analyses of the family Rhabdoviridae, it is hypothesized
      that plant-infecting rhabdoviruses are derived from insect viruses. Analyses of
      viral gene function in plants and insects is beginning to reveal conserved and
      unique biology for these plant viruses in the two diverse hosts. New tools for
      insect molecular biology and infectious clones for plant rhabdoviruses are
      increasing our understanding of the lifestyles of these viruses.

      of a gastric infection on the balance of the intestinal microbiota of birds. In
      this study, 44 faecal samples from individual canaries, with and without M.
      ornithogaster infection, were analysed. The detection of the yeast was evaluated 
      by 18S rRNA PCR. In order to evaluate the impact of the Macrorhabdus infection on
      the bacterial communities, culture-independent methods, by the use of
      amplicon-based sequencing as well as 16S rRNA-DGGE, were adopted. The different
      health status of animals affected the relative abundance of the main OTUs, with a
      greater diversification of the gut microbiota in healthy animals compared to the 
      infected. In particular, Lactococcus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter,
      Lachnospiraceae, Propionibacterium and Weissella were found to be characteristic 
      of uninfected animals (FDR < 0.05), while Lactobacillus and Candidatus
      Arthromitus were characteristic of infected animals (FDR < 0.05). Both these taxa
      have been reported as immunostimulatory, involved in immunological disorders. In 
      infected animals the inferred metagenome assessed by PICRUST clearly showed a
      positive correlation between the presence of M. ornithogaster and KEGG genes
      related to ether lipid metabolism, already reported to be immunostimulatory by
      activation of macrophages and to play a pathophysiological role in several
      immunological disorders. Finally, our results show an interaction between
      infection of the digestive tract and intestinal microbiota of pet birds and
      provide insight into the changing of the complex enteric bacterial community.
      HIGHLIGHTS Macrorabdus ornithogaster is a gastric yeast that colonizes a wide
      range of birds. Differences were found between infected and healthy animals in
      gut microbiota. Candidatus Arthromitus was closely associated with infected
      birds. M. ornithogaster can affect intestinal microbiota composition of canaries.

      Early Production of Hydraulically Fractured Natural Gas Wells in the Appalachian 
      Basin.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing is the prevailing method for enhancing recovery of
      hydrocarbon resources from unconventional shale formations, yet little is
      understood regarding the microbial impact on biogeochemical cycling in
      natural-gas wells. Although the metabolisms of certain fermentative bacteria and 
      methanogenic archaea that dominate in later produced fluids have been well
      studied, few details have been reported on microorganisms prevelant during the
      early flowback period, when oxygen and other surface-derived oxyanions and
      nutrients become depleted. Here, we report the isolation, genomic and phenotypic 
      characterization of Marinobacter and Arcobacter bacterial species from
      natural-gas wells in the Utica-Point Pleasant and Marcellus Formations coupled to
      supporting geochemical and metagenomic analyses of produced fluid samples. These 
      unconventional hydrocarbon system-derived Marinobacter sp. are capable of
      utilizing a diversity of organic carbon sources including aliphatic and aromatic 
      hydrocarbons, amino acids, and carboxylic acids. Marinobacter and Arcobacter can 
      metabolize organic nitrogen sources and have the capacity for denitrification and
      dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) respectively; with DNRA and
      ammonification processes partially explaining high concentrations of ammonia
      measured in produced fluids. Arcobacter is capable of chemosynthetic sulfur
      oxidation, which could fuel metabolic processes for other heterotrophic,
      fermentative, or sulfate-reducing community members. Our analysis revealed
      mechanisms for growth of these taxa across a broad range of salinities (up to 15%
      salt), which explains their enrichment during early natural-gas production. These
      results demonstrate the prevalence of Marinobacter and Arcobacter during a key
      maturation phase of hydraulically fractured natural-gas wells, and highlight the 
      significant role these genera play in biogeochemical cycling for this
      economically important energy system.

TI  - Exploration of deep terrestrial subsurface microbiome in Late Cretaceous Deccan
      traps and underlying Archean basement, India.
PG  - 17459
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-35940-0 [doi]
AB  - Scientific deep drilling at Koyna, western India provides a unique opportunity to
      explore microbial life within deep biosphere hosted by ~65 Myr old Deccan basalt 
      and Archaean granitic basement. Characteristic low organic carbon content,
      mafic/felsic nature but distinct trend in sulfate and nitrate concentrations
      demarcates the basaltic and granitic zones as distinct ecological habitats.
      Quantitative PCR indicates a depth independent distribution of microorganisms
      predominated by bacteria. Abundance of dsrB and mcrA genes are relatively higher 
      (at least one order of magnitude) in basalt compared to granite. Bacterial
      communities are dominated by Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria
      and Firmicutes, whereas Euryarchaeota is the major archaeal group. Strong
      correlation among the abundance of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa is noted.
      Bacteria known for nitrite, sulfur and hydrogen oxidation represent the
      autotrophs. Fermentative, nitrate/sulfate reducing and methane metabolising
      microorganisms represent the heterotrophs. Lack of shared operational taxonomic
      units and distinct clustering of major taxa indicate possible community
      isolation. Shotgun metagenomics corroborate that chemolithoautotrophic
      assimilation of carbon coupled with fermentation and anaerobic respiration drive 
      this deep biosphere. This first report on the geomicrobiology of the subsurface
      of Deccan traps provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand microbial
      composition and function in the terrestrial, igneous rock-hosted, deep biosphere.

PG  - 5053
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07488-0 [doi]
AB  - Biocatalytic cyclization is highly desirable for efficient synthesis of
      biologically derived chemical substances, such as the commodity chemicals
      epsilon-caprolactam and delta-valerolactam. To identify biocatalysts in lactam
      biosynthesis, we develop a caprolactam-detecting genetic enzyme screening system 
      (CL-GESS). The Alcaligenes faecalis regulatory protein NitR is adopted for the
      highly specific detection of lactam compounds against lactam biosynthetic
      intermediates. We further systematically optimize the genetic components of the
      CL-GESS to enhance sensitivity, achieving 10-fold improvement. Using this highly 
      sensitive GESS, we screen marine metagenomes and find an enzyme that cyclizes
      omega-amino fatty acids to lactam. Moreover, we determine the X-ray crystal
      structure and catalytic residues based on mutational analysis of the cyclase. The
      cyclase is also used as a helper enzyme to sense intracellular omega-amino fatty 
      acids. We expect this simple and accurate biosensor to have wide-ranging
      applications in rapid screening of new lactam-synthesizing enzymes and metabolic 
      engineering for lactam bio-production.

TI  - Poplar phyllosphere harbors disparate isoprene-degrading bacteria.
PG  - 13081-13086
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1812668115 [doi]
AB  - The climate-active gas isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is released to the
      atmosphere in huge quantities, almost equaling that of methane, yet we know
      little about the biological cycling of isoprene in the environment. Although
      bacteria capable of growth on isoprene as the sole source of carbon and energy
      have previously been isolated from soils and sediments, no microbiological
      studies have targeted the major source of isoprene and examined the phyllosphere 
      of isoprene-emitting trees for the presence of degraders of this abundant carbon 
      source. Here, we identified isoprene-degrading bacteria in poplar tree-derived
      microcosms by DNA stable isotope probing. The genomes of isoprene-degrading taxa 
      were reconstructed, putative isoprene metabolic genes were identified, and
      isoprene-related gene transcription was analyzed by shotgun metagenomics and
      metatranscriptomics. Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Rhodococcus proved to be
      the dominant isoprene degraders, as previously found in soil. However, a wider
      diversity of isoprene utilizers was also revealed, notably Variovorax, a genus
      not previously associated with this trait. This finding was confirmed by
      expression of the isoprene monooxygenase from Variovorax in a heterologous host. 
      A Variovorax strain that could grow on isoprene as the sole carbon and energy
      source was isolated. Analysis of its genome confirmed that it contained isoprene 
      metabolic genes with an identical layout and high similarity to those identified 
      by DNA-stable isotope probing and metagenomics. This study provides evidence of a
      wide diversity of isoprene-degrading bacteria in the isoprene-emitting tree
      phyllosphere and greatly enhances our understanding of the biodegradation of this
      important metabolite and climate-active gas.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing approaches in microbiome research have allowed surveys
      of microbial communities, their genomes, and their functions with higher
      sensitivity than ever before. However, this sensitivity is a double-edged sword
      because these tools also efficiently detect contaminant DNA and
      cross-contamination, which can confound the interpretation of microbiome data.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate key controls into microbiome
      research to improve the integrity of microbiome studies. Here, we review how
      contaminant DNA and cross-contamination arise within microbiome studies and
      discuss their negative impacts, especially during the analysis of low microbial
      biomass samples. We then identify several key measures that researchers can
      implement to reduce the impact of contaminant DNA and cross-contamination during 
      microbiome research. We put forward a set of minimal experimental criteria, the
      'RIDE' checklist, to improve the validity of future low microbial biomass
      research.

TI  - Understanding the microbial basis of body odor in pre-pubescent children and
      teenagers.
PG  - 213
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0588-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though human sweat is odorless, bacterial growth and
      decomposition of specific odor precursors in it is believed to give rise to body 
      odor in humans. While mechanisms of odor generation have been widely studied in
      adults, little is known for teenagers and pre-pubescent children who have
      distinct sweat composition from immature apocrine and sebaceous glands, but are
      arguably more susceptible to the social and psychological impact of malodor.
      RESULTS: We integrated information from whole microbiome analysis of multiple
      skin sites (underarm, neck, and head) and multiple time points (1 h and 8 h after
      bath), analyzing 180 samples in total to perform the largest metagenome-wide
      association study to date on malodor. Significant positive correlations were
      observed between odor intensity and the relative abundance of Staphylococcus
      hominis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium avidum, as well as
      negative correlation with Acinetobacter schindleri and Cutibacterium species.
      Metabolic pathway analysis highlighted the association of isovaleric and acetic
      acid production (sour odor) from enriched S. epidermidis (teen underarm) and S.
      hominis (child neck) enzymes and sulfur production from Staphylococcus species
      (teen underarm) with odor intensity, in good agreement with observed odor
      characteristics in pre-pubescent children and teenagers. Experiments with
      cultures on human and artificial sweat confirmed the ability of S. hominis and S.
      epidermidis to independently produce malodor with distinct odor characteristics. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results showcase the power of skin metagenomics to study
      host-microbial co-metabolic interactions, identifying distinct pathways for odor 
      generation from sweat in pre-pubescent children and teenagers and highlighting
      key enzymatic targets for intervention.

TI  - Efficient computation of spaced seed hashing with block indexing.
PG  - 441
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2415-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spaced-seeds, i.e. patterns in which some fixed positions are allowed
      to be wild-cards, play a crucial role in several bioinformatics applications
      involving substrings counting and indexing, by often providing better sensitivity
      with respect to k-mers based approaches. K-mers based approaches are usually
      fast, being based on efficient hashing and indexing that exploits the large
      overlap between consecutive k-mers. Spaced-seeds hashing is not as
      straightforward, and it is usually computed from scratch for each position in the
      input sequence. Recently, the FSH (Fast Spaced seed Hashing) approach was
      proposed to improve the time required for computation of the spaced seed hashing 
      of DNA sequences with a speed-up of about 1.5 with respect to standard hashing
      computation. RESULTS: In this work we propose a novel algorithm, Fast Indexing
      for Spaced seed Hashing (FISH), based on the indexing of small blocks that can be
      combined to obtain the hashing of spaced-seeds of any length. The method exploits
      the fast computation of the hashing of runs of consecutive 1 in the spaced seeds,
      that basically correspond to k-mer of the length of the run. CONCLUSIONS: We run 
      several experiments, on NGS data from simulated and synthetic metagenomic
      experiments, to assess the time required for the computation of the hashing for
      each position in each read with respect to several spaced seeds. In our
      experiments, FISH can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup, 
      with respect to the traditional approach, between 1.9x to 6.03x, depending on the
      structure of the spaced seeds.

TI  - GLOSSary: the GLobal Ocean 16S subunit web accessible resource.
PG  - 443
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2423-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental metagenomics is a challenging approach that is
      exponentially spreading in the scientific community to investigate taxonomic
      diversity and possible functions of the biological components. The massive amount
      of sequence data produced, often endowed with rich environmental metadata, needs 
      suitable computational tools to fully explore the embedded information.
      Bioinformatics plays a key role in providing methodologies to manage, process and
      mine molecular data, integrated with environmental metagenomics collections. One 
      such relevant example is represented by the Tara Ocean Project. RESULTS: We
      considered the Tara 16S miTAGs released by the consortium, representing raw
      sequences from a shotgun metagenomics approach with similarities to 16S rRNA
      genes. We generated assembled 16S rDNA sequences, which were classified according
      to their lengths, the possible presence of chimeric reads, the putative taxonomic
      affiliation. The dataset was included in GLOSSary (the GLobal Ocean 16S Subunit
      web accessible resource), a bioinformatics platform to organize environmental
      metagenomics data. The aims of this work were: i) to present alternative
      computational approaches to manage challenging metagenomics data; ii) to set up
      user friendly web-based platforms to allow the integration of environmental
      metagenomics sequences and of the associated metadata; iii) to implement an
      appropriate bioinformatics platform supporting the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences
      exploiting reference datasets, such as the SILVA database. We organized the data 
      in a next-generation NoSQL "schema-less" database, allowing flexible organization
      of large amounts of data and supporting native geospatial queries. A web
      interface was developed to permit an interactive exploration and a visual
      geographical localization of the data, either raw miTAG reads or 16S contigs,
      from our processing pipeline. Information on unassembled sequences is also
      available. The taxonomic affiliations of contigs and miTAGs, and the spatial
      distribution of the sampling sites and their associated sequence libraries, as
      they are contained in the Tara metadata, can be explored by a query interface,
      which allows both textual and visual investigations. In addition, all the
      sequence data were made available for a dedicated BLAST-based web application
      alongside the SILVA collection. CONCLUSIONS: GLOSSary provides an expandable
      bioinformatics environment, able to support the scientific community in current
      and forthcoming environmental metagenomics analyses.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of
      virus diversity and evolution. In the case of arenaviruses, which are the focus
      of this review, metagenomic/metatranscriptomic approaches identified
      reptile-infecting and fish-infecting viruses, also showing that bi-segmented
      genomes are not a universal feature of the Arenaviridae family. Novel
      mammarenaviruses were described, allowing inference of their geographic origin
      and evolutionary dynamics. Extensive sequencing of Lassa virus (LASV) genomes
      revealed the zoonotic nature of most human infections and a Nigerian origin of
      LASV, which subsequently spread westward. Future efforts will likely identify
      many more arenaviruses and hopefully provide insight into the ultimate origin of 
      the family, the pathogenic potential of its members, as well as the determinants 
      of their geographic distribution.

TI  - Rumen microbiome in dairy calves fed copper and grape-pomace dietary
      supplementations: Composition and predicted functional profile.
PG  - e0205670
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0205670 [doi]
AB  - The rumen microbiome is fundamental for the productivity and health of dairy
      cattle and diet is known to influence the rumen microbiota composition. In this
      study, grape-pomace, a natural source of polyphenols, and copper sulfate were
      provided as feed supplementation in 15 Holstein-Friesian calves, including 5
      controls. After 75 days of supplementation, genomic DNA was extracted from the
      rumen liquor and prepared for 16S rRNA-gene sequencing to characterize the
      composition of the rumen microbiota. From this, the rumen metagenome was
      predicted to obtain the associated gene functions and metabolic pathways in a
      cost-effective manner. Results showed that feed supplementations did alter the
      rumen microbiome of calves. Copper and grape-pomace increased the diversity of
      the rumen microbiota: the Shannon's and Fisher's alpha indices were significantly
      different across groups (p-values 0.045 and 0.039), and Bray-Curtis distances
      could separate grape-pomace calves from the other two groups. Differentially
      abundant taxa were identified: in particular, an uncultured Bacteroidales UCG-001
      genus and OTUs from genus Sarcina were the most differentially abundant in
      pomace-supplemented calves compared to controls (p-values 0.003 and 0.0002,
      respectively). Enriched taxonomies such as Ruminiclostridium and Eubacterium sp.,
      whose functions are related to degradation of the grape- pomace constituents
      (e.g. flavonoids or xyloglucan) have been described (p-values 0.027/0.028 and
      0.040/0.022 in Pomace vs Copper and Controls, respectively). The most abundant
      predicted metagenomic genes belonged to the arginine and proline metabolism and
      the two- component (sensor/responder) regulatory system, which were increased in 
      the supplemented groups. Interestingly, the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic
      pathway was decreased in the two supplemented groups, possibly as a result of
      antimicrobial effects. Methanogenic taxa also responded to the feed
      supplementation, and methane metabolism in the rumen was the second most
      different pathway (up-regulated by feed supplementations) between experimental
      groups.

TI  - Predominance and high diversity of genes associated to denitrification in
      metagenomes of subantarctic coastal sediments exposed to urban pollution.
PG  - e0207606
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0207606 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to characterize the microbial nitrogen cycling potential
      in sediments from Ushuaia Bay, a subantarctic environment that has suffered a
      recent explosive demographic growth. Subtidal sediment samples were retrieved in 
      triplicate from two urban points in the Bay, and analyzed through metagenomic
      shotgun sequencing. Sequences assigned to genes related to nitrification, nitrate
      reduction and denitrification were predominant in this environment with respect
      to metagenomes from other environments, including other marine sediments. The
      nosZ gene, responsible for nitrous oxide transformation into di-nitrogen,
      presented a high diversity. The majority of NosZ sequences were classified as
      Clade II (atypical) variants affiliated to different bacterial lineages such as
      Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, as well 
      as to Archaea. The analysis of a fosmid metagenomic library from the same site
      showed that the genomic context of atypical variants was variable, and was
      accompanied by distinct regulatory elements, suggesting the evolution of
      differential ecophysiological roles. This work increases our understanding of the
      microbial ecology of nitrogen transformations in cold coastal environments and
      provides evidence of an enhanced denitrification potential in impacted sediment
      microbial communities. In addition, it highlights the role of yet overlooked
      populations in the mitigation of environmentally harmful forms of nitrogen.

TI  - Breeding-assisted genomics: Applying meta-GWAS for milling and baking quality in 
      CIMMYT wheat breeding program.
PG  - e0204757
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0204757 [doi]
AB  - One of the biggest challenges for genetic studies on natural or unstructured
      populations is the unbalanced datasets where individuals are measured at
      different times and environments. This problem is also common in crop and animal 
      breeding where many individuals are only evaluated for a single year and large
      but unbalanced datasets can be generated over multiple years. Many wheat breeding
      programs have focused on increasing bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, but
      processing and end-use quality are critical components when considering its use
      in feeding the rising population of the next century. The challenges with end-use
      quality trait improvements are high cost and seed amounts for testing, the latter
      making selection in early breeding populations impossible. Here we describe a
      novel approach to identify marker-trait associations within a breeding program
      using a meta-genome wide association study (GWAS), which combines GWAS analysis
      from multi-year unbalanced breeding nurseries, in a manner reflecting meta-GWAS
      in humans. This method facilitated mapping of processing and end-use quality
      phenotypes from advanced breeding lines (n = 4,095) of the CIMMYT bread wheat
      breeding program from 2009 to 2014. Using the meta-GWAS we identified
      marker-trait associations, allele effects, candidate genes, and can select using 
      markers generated in this process. Finally, the scope of this approach can be
      broadly applied in 'breeding-assisted genomics' across many crops to greatly
      increase our functional understanding of plant genomes.

TI  - Exploring oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) substrate preparation by varying 
      phase I composting time: changes in bacterial communities and physicochemical
      composition of biomass impacting mushroom yields.
PG  - 931-944
LID - 10.1111/jam.14168 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate characterization of the bacterial community composition and 
      functionality and their impact on substrate biodegradation as well as mushroom
      yield. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial diversity, composition and functionality
      were accessed by DNA-derived analysis for a sugarcane straw-based substrate
      composted for either 5, 10 or 15 days. In addition, carbon and nitrogen losses,
      carbohydrate conversion and mushroom yields were measured for the different
      treatments. Changes were observed in the bacterial community diversity and
      composition after the process started, but not during the composting process
      itself. Following phase I, Acinetobacter sequences were recovered in high
      numbers, and selected genes associated with nitrogen metabolism and
      lignocellulose deconstruction were mapped. Substrate physicochemical composition 
      showed elevated carbon and nitrogen losses after 10 and 15 days of phase I with
      reductions in mushroom yield. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter species appear to play
      an important role in substrate degradation processes, and a 5-day phase I period 
      showed a significant higher mushroom yield compared to composting for either 10
      or 15 days. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study confers a better
      understanding of the bacterial community manipulation during the substrate
      preparation and their influence in substrate selectivity for the Pleurotus
      ostreatus cultivation.

AB  - AIMS: In this study, the ability of the consortium MR-01 to degrade phenol was
      determined. The effects of this chemical on the taxonomy and the metabolic
      behaviour were analysed through metagenomics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consortium
      MR-01 was acclimated in a sublethal concentration of phenol. After this process, 
      the capacity to degrade this molecule was analysed. Results showed that
      degradation increased with the increment of the initial phenol concentration.
      Metagenomic analysis indicates that the consortium metabolized phenol under
      aerobic conditions using phenol 2-monooxygenase and the meta-cleavage pathway.
      Sequence of the enzymes involved in the phenol degradation was ascribed to the
      Actinomycetales and Chloroflexales orders, with relative abundances <1%. The most
      abundant genera were part of the Sphingomonadales order; however, the role of
      these species in the consortium is not clear. CONCLUSIONS: Consortium MR-01
      degrades efficiently high concentrations of phenol. The participation of
      extremophiles in the degradation process and the emergence of beneficial
      metabolic dependencies between the community members are some of the strategies
      used by the consortium to survive and develop under harsh environmental
      conditions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is one of the few studies 
      describing the taxonomy and metabolic profile of a phenol degrading consortium.

AB  - Coastal estuaries and bays are exposed to both natural and anthropogenic
      environmental changes, inflicting intensive stress on the microbial communities
      inhabiting these areas. However, it remains unclear how microbial community
      diversity and their eco-functions are affected by anthropogenic disturbances
      rather than natural environmental changes. Here, we explored sediment microbial
      functional genes dynamics and community interaction networks in Hangzhou Bay
      (HZB), one of the most severely polluted bays on China's eastern coast. The
      results indicated key microbial functional gene categories, including N, P, S,
      and aromatic compound metabolism, and stress response, displayed significant
      spatial dynamics along environmental gradients. Sensitive feedbacks of key
      functional gene categories to N and P pollutants demonstrated potential impacts
      of human-induced seawater pollutants to microbial functional capacity. Seawater
      ammonia and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was identified as primary drivers 
      in selecting adaptive populations and varying community composition. Network
      analysis revealed distinct modules that were stimulated in inner or outer bay.
      Importantly, the network keystone species, which played a fundamental role in
      community interactions, were strongly affected by N-pollutants. Our results
      provide a systematic understanding of the microbial compositional and functional 
      dynamics in an urbanized coastal estuary, and highlighted the impact of human
      activities on these communities.

      Nasal Epithelial Cells From Multiple Individuals Reveal Specific Nasal-Initiated 
      Signatures.
PG  - 2685
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02685 [doi]
AB  - In vitro and in vivo research based on cell lines and animals are likely to be
      insufficient in elucidating authentic biological and physiological phenomena
      mimicking human systems, especially for generating pre-clinical data on targets
      and biomarkers. There is an obvious need for a model that can further bridge the 
      gap in translating pre-clinical findings into clinical applications. We have
      previously generated a model of in vitro differentiated human nasal epithelial
      cells (hNECs) which elucidated the nasal-initiated repertoire of immune responses
      against respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus. To assess
      their clinical utility, we performed a microarray analysis of influenza
      virus-infected hNECs to elucidate nasal epithelial-initiated responses. This was 
      followed by a metagenomic analysis which revealed transcriptomic changes
      comparable with clinical influenza datasets. The primary target of influenza
      infection was observed to be the initiator of innate and adaptive immune genes,
      leaning toward type-1 inflammatory activation. In addition, the model also
      elucidated a down-regulation of metabolic processes specific to the nasal
      epithelium, and not present in other models. Furthermore, the hNEC model detected
      all 11 gene signatures unique to influenza infection identified from a previous
      study, thus supporting the utility of nasal-based diagnosis in clinical settings.
      In conclusion, this study highlights that hNECs can serve as a model for
      nasal-based clinical translational studies and diagnosis to unravel nasal
      epithelial responses to influenza in the population, and as a means to identify
      novel molecular diagnostic markers of severity.

      future prospects.
PG  - 323-332
LID - 10.1194/jlr.R088989 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as a crucial factor that influences
      cholesterol metabolism. Ever since, significant interest has been shown in
      investigating these host-microbiome interactions to uncover microbiome-mediated
      functions on cholesterol and bile acid (BA) metabolism. Indeed, changes in gut
      microbiota composition and, hence, its derived metabolites have been previously
      reported to subsequently impact the metabolic processes and have been linked to
      several diseases. In this context, associations between a disrupted gut
      microbiome, impaired BA metabolism, and cholesterol dysregulation have been
      highlighted. Extensive advances in metagenomic and metabolomic studies in this
      field have allowed us to further our understanding of the role of intestinal
      bacteria in metabolic health and disease. However, only a few have provided
      mechanistic insights into their impact on cholesterol metabolism. Identifying the
      myriad functions and interactions of these bacteria to maintain cholesterol
      homeostasis remain an important challenge in such a field of research. In this
      review, we discuss the impact of gut microbiota on cholesterol metabolism, its
      association with disease settings, and the potential of modulating gut microbiota
      as a promising therapeutic target to lower hypercholesterolemia.

AB  - Eco-agricultural systems aim to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers in order
      to improve sustainable production and maintain a healthy ecosystem. The aim of
      this study was to explore the effects of rice-frog farming on the bacterial
      community and N-cycling microbes in paddy rhizosphere soil. This experiment
      involved three rice cultivation patterns: Conventionally cultivated rice (CR),
      green rice-frog farming (GR), and organic rice-frog farming (OR). The rice yield,
      paddy soil enzyme activities, physicochemical variables and bacterial and
      N-cycling bacterial abundances were quantitatively analyzed. Rice-frog
      cultivations significantly increased soil protease, nitrate and reductase
      activity. Additionally, the nirS gene copy number and the relative abundance of
      denitrifying bacteria also increased, however urease activity and the relative
      abundance of nitrifying bacteria significantly decreased. The bacterial community
      richness and diversity of OR soil was significantly higher than that of the GR or
      CR soil. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of GR was highest. The N-cycling bacterial
      community was positively correlated with the total carbon (TC), total nitrogren
      (TN) and carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio. The present work strengthens our current
      understanding of the soil bacterial community structure and its functions under
      rice-frog farming. The present work also provides certain theoretical support for
      the selection of rational rice cultivation patterns.

TI  - Communities of Phytoplankton Viruses across the Transition Zone of the St.
      Lawrence Estuary.

LID - 10.3390/v10120672 [doi]
AB  - The St. Lawrence hydrographic system includes freshwater, brackish, and marine
      habitats, and is the largest waterway in North America by volume. The food-webs
      in these habitats are ultimately dependent on phytoplankton. Viral lysis is
      believed to be responsible for a major part of phytoplankton mortality. To better
      understand their role, we characterized the diversity and distribution of two
      viral taxa infecting phytoplankton: the picornaviruses and phycodnaviruses. Our
      study focused on the estuary transition zone, which is an important nursery for
      invertebrates and fishes. Both viral taxa were investigated by PCR amplification 
      of conserved molecular markers and next-generation sequencing at six sites,
      ranging from freshwater to marine. Our results revealed few shared viral
      phylotypes between saltwater and freshwater sites. Salinity appeared to be the
      primary determinant of viral community composition. Moreover, our analysis
      indicated that the viruses identified in this region of the St. Lawrence diverge 
      from classified viruses and homologous published environmental virotypes. These
      results suggest that DNA and RNA viruses infecting phytoplankton are likely
      active in the estuary transition zone, and that this region harbors its own
      unique viral assemblages.

AB  - In recent years, the human microbiota has gained increasing relevance both in
      research and clinical fields. Increasing studies seem to suggest the centrality
      of the microbiota and its composition both in the development and maintenance of 
      what we call "health" and in generating and/or favoring (those cases in which the
      microbiota's complex relational architecture is dysregulated) the onset of
      pathological conditions. The complex relationships between the microbiota and
      human beings, which invest core notions of biomedicine such as "health" and
      "individual," do concern not only problems of an empirical nature but seem to
      require the need to adopt new concepts and new perspectives in order to be
      properly analysed and utilized, especially for their therapeutic implementation. 
      In this contribution we report and discuss some of the theoretical proposals and 
      innovations (from the ecological component to the notion of polygenomic organism)
      aimed at producing this change of perspective. In conclusion, we summarily
      analyze what impact and what new challenges these new approaches might have on
      personalized/person centred/precision medicine.

LID - 10.3390/biology7040050 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms are able to influence several aspects of insects' life, and this
      statement is gaining increasing strength, as research demonstrates it daily. At
      the same time, new sequencing technologies are now available at a lower cost per 
      base, and bioinformatic procedures are becoming more user-friendly. This is
      triggering a huge effort in studying the microbial diversity associated to
      insects, and especially to economically important insect pests. The importance of
      the microbiome has been widely acknowledged for a wide range of animals, and also
      for insects this topic is gaining considerable importance. In addition to
      bacterial-associates, the insect-associated fungal communities are also gaining
      attention, especially those including plant pathogens. The use of meta-omics
      tools is not restricted to the description of the microbial world, but it can be 
      also used in bio-surveillance, food safety assessment, or even to bring novelties
      to the industry. This mini-review aims to give a wide overview of how meta-omics 
      tools are fostering advances in research on insect-microorganism interactions.

      selection.
PG  - 366-376
LID - 10.1111/1755-0998.12971 [doi]
AB  - Effective biomonitoring is critical for driving management outcomes that ensure
      long-term sustainability of the marine environment. In recent years,
      environmental DNA (eDNA), coupled with metabarcoding methodologies, has emerged
      as a promising tool for generating biotic surveys of marine ecosystems, including
      those under anthropogenic pressure. However, more empirical data are needed on
      how to best implement eDNA field sampling approaches to maximize their utility
      for each specific application. The effect of the substrate chosen for eDNA
      sampling on the diversity of marine taxa detected by DNA metabarcoding has not
      yet been systematically analysed, despite aquatic systems being those most
      commonly targeted for eDNA studies. We investigated the effect of four commonly
      used eDNA substrates to explore taxonomic diversity: (a) surface water, (b)
      marine sediment, (c) settlement plates and (d) planktonic tows. With a focus on
      coastal ports, 332 eDNA samples from Australia (Indian and Southern oceans) and
      Kazakhstan (Caspian Sea) were collected and analysed by multi-assay DNA
      metabarcoding. Across study locations, between 30% and 52% of eukaryotic families
      detected were unique to a particular substrate and <6% of families were found in 
      all four substrates. Taxonomic composition varied significantly depending on the 
      substrate sampled implying that the suitability (and bias) of an eDNA substrate
      will depend on the focal taxa. These findings demonstrate that single substrate
      eDNA metabarcoding likely underestimates the total eukaryotic diversity. Future
      eDNA experimental design should consider incorporating multiple substrates or
      select substrate(s) best suited to the specific detection of target taxa.

TI  - Phylogenomics of Endogonaceae and evolution of mycorrhizas within Mucoromycota.
PG  - 511-525
LID - 10.1111/nph.15613 [doi]
AB  - Endogonales (Mucoromycotina), composed of Endogonaceae and Densosporaceae, is the
      only known non-Dikarya order with ectomycorrhizal members. They also form
      mycorrhizal-like association with some nonspermatophyte plants. It has been
      recently proposed that Endogonales were among the earliest mycorrhizal partners
      with land plants. It remains unknown whether Endogonales possess genomes with
      mycorrhizal-lifestyle signatures and whether Endogonales originated around the
      same time as land plants did. We sampled sporocarp tissue from four Endogonaceae 
      collections and performed shotgun genome sequencing. After binning the metagenome
      data, we assembled and annotated the Endogonaceae genomes. We performed
      comparative analysis on plant-cell-wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) and small
      secreted proteins (SSPs). We inferred phylogenetic placement of Endogonaceae and 
      estimated the ages of Endogonaceae and Endogonales with expanded taxon sampling. 
      Endogonaceae have large genomes with high repeat content, low diversity of
      PCWDEs, but without elevated SSP/secretome ratios. Dating analysis estimated that
      Endogonaceae originated in the Permian-Triassic boundary and Endogonales
      originated in the mid-late Silurian. Mycoplasma-related endobacterium sequences
      were identified in three Endogonaceae genomes. Endogonaceae genomes possess
      typical signatures of mycorrhizal lifestyle. The early origin of Endogonales
      suggests that the mycorrhizal association between Endogonales and plants might
      have played an important role during the colonization of land by plants.

AB  - Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, currently dominate 
      genome-wide gene expression studies. A standard approach to analyse this data
      requires mapping sequence reads to a reference and counting the number of reads
      which map to each gene. However, for many transcriptome studies, a suitable
      reference genome is unavailable, especially for meta-transcriptome studies which 
      assay gene expression from mixed populations of organisms. Where a reference is
      unavailable, it is possible to generate a reference by the de novo assembly of
      the sequence reads. However, the high cost of generating high-coverage data for
      de novo assembly hinders this approach and more importantly the accurate assembly
      of such data is challenging, especially for meta-transcriptome data, and
      resulting assemblies frequently suffer from collapsed regions or chimeric
      sequences. As an alternative to the standard reference mapping approach, we have 
      developed a k-mer-based analysis pipeline (DiffKAP) to identify differentially
      expressed reads between RNA-Seq datasets without the requirement for a reference.
      We compared the DiffKAP approach with the traditional Tophat/Cuffdiff method
      using RNA-Seq data from soybean, which has a suitable reference genome. We
      subsequently examined differential gene expression for a coral meta-transcriptome
      where no reference is available, and validated the results using qRT-PCR. We
      conclude that DiffKAP is an accurate method to study differential gene expression
      in complex meta-transcriptomes without the requirement of a reference genome.

TI  - Integrating host response and unbiased microbe detection for lower respiratory
      tract infection diagnosis in critically ill adults.
PG  - E12353-E12362
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1809700115 [doi]
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) lead to more deaths each year than any
      other infectious disease category. Despite this, etiologic LRTI pathogens are
      infrequently identified due to limitations of existing microbiologic tests. In
      critically ill patients, noninfectious inflammatory syndromes resembling LRTIs
      further complicate diagnosis. To address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, 
      we performed metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) on tracheal aspirates 
      from 92 adults with acute respiratory failure and simultaneously assessed
      pathogens, the airway microbiome, and the host transcriptome. To differentiate
      pathogens from respiratory commensals, we developed a rules-based model (RBM) and
      logistic regression model (LRM) in a derivation cohort of 20 patients with LRTIs 
      or noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in an independent
      validation cohort of 24 patients, both models achieved accuracies of 95.5%. We
      next developed pathogen, microbiome diversity, and host gene expression metrics
      to identify LRTI-positive patients and differentiate them from critically ill
      controls with noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in the
      validation cohort, the pathogen metric performed with an area under the
      receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86-1.00), the diversity metric 
      with an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63-0.98), and the host transcriptional classifier 
      with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00). Combining these achieved a negative
      predictive value of 100%. This study suggests that a single streamlined protocol 
      offering an integrated genomic portrait of pathogen, microbiome, and host
      transcriptome may hold promise as a tool for LRTI diagnosis.

LID - e02329-18 [pii]

AB  - Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous
      diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us 
      to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the
      dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA
      viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We
      developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp
      phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying
      multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus
      RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense 
      RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
      viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (-) RNA viruses, respectively.
      This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at
      least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses.
      Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold
      suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses
      encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent
      evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those 
      encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and
      facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic
      analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and
      horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network
      of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand,
      the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus
      taxonomy.IMPORTANCE The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have
      RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent
      advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA
      viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete
      reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than was attainable previously.
      This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore classes
      of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related 
      hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the
      existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.

AB  - To address the question of how microbial diversity and function in the oral
      cavities of children relates to caries diagnosis, we surveyed the supragingival
      plaque biofilm microbiome in 44 juvenile twin pairs. Using shotgun sequencing, we
      constructed a genome encyclopedia describing the core supragingival plaque
      microbiome. Caries phenotypes contained statistically significant enrichments in 
      specific genome abundances and distinct community composition profiles, including
      strain-level changes. Metabolic pathways that are statistically associated with
      caries include several sugar-associated phosphotransferase systems, antimicrobial
      resistance, and metal transport. Numerous closely related previously
      uncharacterized microbes had substantial variation in central metabolism,
      including the loss of biosynthetic pathways resulting in auxotrophy, changing the
      ecological role. We also describe the first complete Gracilibacteria genomes from
      the human microbiome. Caries is a microbial community metabolic disorder that
      cannot be described by a single etiology, and our results provide the information
      needed for next-generation diagnostic tools and therapeutics for
      caries.IMPORTANCE Oral health has substantial economic importance, with over $100
      billion spent on dental care in the United States annually. The microbiome plays 
      a critical role in oral health, yet remains poorly classified. To address the
      question of how microbial diversity and function in the oral cavities of children
      relate to caries diagnosis, we surveyed the supragingival plaque biofilm
      microbiome in 44 juvenile twin pairs. Using shotgun sequencing, we constructed a 
      genome encyclopedia describing the core supragingival plaque microbiome. This
      unveiled several new previously uncharacterized but ubiquitous microbial lineages
      in the oral microbiome. Caries is a microbial community metabolic disorder that
      cannot be described by a single etiology, and our results provide the information
      needed for next-generation diagnostic tools and therapeutics for caries.

TI  - Medaka Population Genome Structure and Demographic History Described via

AB  - Medaka is a model organism in medicine, genetics, developmental biology and
      population genetics. Lab stocks composed of more than 100 local wild populations 
      are available for research in these fields. Thus, medaka represents a potentially
      excellent bioresource for screening disease-risk- and adaptation-related genes in
      genome-wide association studies. Although the genetic population structure should
      be known before performing such an analysis, a comprehensive study on the
      genome-wide diversity of wild medaka populations has not been performed. Here, we
      performed genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) for 81 and 12 medakas captured from a
      bioresource and the wild, respectively. Based on the GBS data, we evaluated the
      genetic population structure and estimated the demographic parameters using an
      approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. The genome-wide data confirmed 
      that there were substantial differences between local populations and supported
      our previously proposed hypothesis on medaka dispersal based on mitochondrial
      genome (mtDNA) data. A new finding was that a local group that was thought to be 
      a hybrid between the northern and the southern Japanese groups was actually an
      origin of the northern Japanese group. Thus, this paper presents the first
      population-genomic study of medaka and reveals its population structure and
      history based on chromosomal genetic diversity.

AB  - Exploring the microbial diversity of ticks is crucial to understand geographical 
      dispersion and pathogen transmission. Tick microbes participate in many
      biological processes implicated in the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission
      of pathogens, and actively promote host phenotypic changes, and adaptation to new
      environments. The microbial community of Ixodes ventalloi still remains
      unexplored. In this study, the bacterial microbiota of wild-caught I. ventalloi
      was characterized using shotgun-metagenomic sequencing in samples from unfed
      adults collected during December 2013-January 2014 in two locations from Sicily, 
      Italy. The microbiota identified in I. ventalloi was mainly composed of
      symbiotic, commensal, and environmental bacteria. Interestingly, we identified
      the genera Anaplasma and Borrelia as members of the microbiota of I. ventalloi.
      These results advance our information on I. ventalloi microbiota composition,
      with potential implications in tick-host adaptation, geographic expansion, and
      vector competence.

TI  - The chicken gut metagenome and the modulatory effects of plant-derived
      benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.
PG  - 211
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0590-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-therapeutic antibiotics are widely used as growth promoters in
      the poultry industry; however, the resulting antibiotic resistance threatens
      public health. A plant-derived growth promoter, Macleaya cordata extract (MCE),
      with effective ingredients of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, is a potential
      alternative to antibiotic growth promoters. Altered intestinal microbiota play
      important roles in growth promotion, but the underlying mechanism remains
      unknown. RESULTS: We generated 1.64 terabases of metagenomic data from 495
      chicken intestinal digesta samples and constructed a comprehensive chicken gut
      microbial gene catalog (9.04 million genes), which is also the first gene catalog
      of an animal's gut microbiome that covers all intestinal compartments. Then, we
      identified the distinctive characteristics and temporal changes in the foregut
      and hindgut microbiota. Next, we assessed the impact of MCE on chickens and gut
      microbiota. Chickens fed with MCE had improved growth performance, and major
      microbial changes were confined to the foregut, with the predominant role of
      Lactobacillus being enhanced, and the amino acids, vitamins, and secondary bile
      acids biosynthesis pathways being upregulated, but lacked the accumulation of
      antibiotic-resistance genes. In comparison, treatment with chlortetracycline
      similarly enriched some biosynthesis pathways of nutrients in the foregut
      microbiota, but elicited an increase in antibiotic-producing bacteria and
      antibiotic-resistance genes. CONCLUSION: The reference gene catalog of the
      chicken gut microbiome is an important supplement to animal gut metagenomes.
      Metagenomic analysis provides insights into the growth-promoting mechanism of
      MCE, and underscored the importance of utilizing safe and effective growth
      promoters.

      sources posing public health threats. However, these findings were based on the
      identification of culturable bacteria and at times not below burial grounds.
      Investigation on the bacterial diversity and functional profiles of bacterial
      communities above and below burial grounds in human cemeteries are few. The
      current study used high-throughput sequencing techniques to determine the
      bacterial composition and their associated functional profiles in cemetery soil
      samples collected at the surface and below burial ground in two South African
      cemeteries (Maitland Cemetery in Cape Town and Fontein Street Cemetery in
      Middelburg) to evaluate the potential health threat to surrounding populations
      through contamination of groundwater. Significant differences were observed
      between sample depths with the clustering of the surface (0m) and the 2m samples 
      into separate groups. Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant
      genera across all samples. Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus were the dominant genera
      in the 2m samples while Prauserella and Staphylococcus were dominant in the
      surface samples. The 2m samples showed a lower alpha diversity but recorded
      higher proportions of human diseases functional classes compared to the surface
      samples. Human disease functional profiles revealed involvement, in infectious
      (cholera), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease) cardiovascular (hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy) immune system (Systemic lupus erythematosus) metabolic (Type I & 
      II diabetes) diseases and cancer. Antibiotic resistance and antibiotics synthesis
      signatures were also identified. Thus, cemeteries could be potential sources of
      microbial and antibiotic pollution in groundwater, especially in areas with
      shallow water tables such as Maitland. Selection of sites for use as cemeteries
      should, therefore, require a proper understanding of the hydrogeological
      characteristics of the selected site. However, further studies are required to
      trace the actual movement of these pollutants into groundwater resources.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of sample collection approaches and DNA 
      metabarcoding to identify plants utilized by nectivorous bats. Samples included
      guano collected from beneath bat roosts and pollen-swabs from bat fur, both of
      which were subjected to DNA metabarcoding and visual identification of pollen
      (microscopy) to measure plant diversity. Our objectives were to determine whether
      DNA metabarcoding could detect likely food plants of nectivorous bats, whether
      sample types would produce different estimates of plant diversity, and to compare
      results of DNA metabarcoding to visual identification. Visual identification
      found that 99% of pollen was from Agave, which is thought to be the bats' main
      food source. The dominant taxon found by metabarcoding was also Agavoideae, but a
      broader diversity of plant species was also detected, many of which are likely
      "by-catch" from the broader environment. Metabarcoding outcomes differed between 
      sample types, likely because pollen-swabs measured the plant species visited by
      bats and guano samples measured all items consumed in the bat's diet, even those 
      that were not pollen or nectar. Overall, metabarcoding is a powerful,
      high-throughput tool to understand bat ecology and species interactions, but
      careful analysis of results is necessary to derive accurate ecological
      conclusions.

TI  - Human milk oligosaccharides, milk microbiome and infant gut microbiome modulate
      neonatal rotavirus infection.
PG  - 5010
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07476-4 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal rotavirus infections are predominantly asymptomatic. While an
      association with gastrointestinal symptoms has been described in some settings,
      factors influencing differences in clinical presentation are not well understood.
      Using multidisciplinary approaches, we show that a complex interplay between
      human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), milk microbiome, and infant gut microbiome
      impacts neonatal rotavirus infections. Validating in vitro studies where HMOs are
      not decoy receptors for neonatal strain G10P[11], population studies show
      significantly higher levels of Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL), 
      and 6'-siallylactose (6'SL) in milk from mothers of rotavirus-positive neonates
      with gastrointestinal symptoms. Further, these HMOs correlate with abundance of
      Enterobacter/Klebsiella in maternal milk and infant stool. Specific HMOs also
      improve the infectivity of a neonatal strain-derived rotavirus vaccine. This
      study provides molecular and translational insight into host factors influencing 
      neonatal rotavirus infections and identifies maternal components that could
      promote the performance of live, attenuated rotavirus vaccines.

AB  - Ensuring that the wealth of resources contained in our oceans are managed and
      developed in a sustainable manner is a priority for the emerging 'blue economy'. 
      However, modern ecosystem-based management approaches do not translate well to
      regions where we know almost nothing about the individual species found in the
      ecosystem. Here, we propose a new taxon-focused approach to deep-sea conservation
      that includes regulatory oversight to set targets for the delivery of taxonomic
      data. For example, a five-year plan to deliver taxonomic and genomic knowledge on
      a thousand species in regions of the ocean earmarked for industrial activity is
      an achievable target. High-throughput, integrative taxonomy can, therefore,
      provide the data that is needed to monitor various ecosystem services (such as
      the natural history, connectivity, value and function of species) and to help
      break the regulatory deadlock of high-seas conservation.

TI  - Tongue coating microbiome as a potential biomarker for gastritis including
      precancerous cascade.
PG  - 496-509
LID - 10.1007/s13238-018-0596-6 [doi]
AB  - The development of gastritis is associated with an increased risk of gastric
      cancer. Current invasive gastritis diagnostic methods are not suitable for
      monitoring progress. In this work based on 78 gastritis patients and 50 healthy
      individuals, we observed that the variation of tongue-coating microbiota was
      associated with the occurrence and development of gastritis. Twenty-one microbial
      species were identified for differentiating tongue-coating microbiomes of
      gastritis and healthy individuals. Pathways such as microbial metabolism in
      diverse environments, biosynthesis of antibiotics and bacterial chemotaxis were
      up-regulated in gastritis patients. The abundance of Campylobacter concisus was
      found associated with the gastric precancerous cascade. Furthermore,
      Campylobacter concisus could be detected in tongue coating and gastric fluid in a
      validation cohort containing 38 gastritis patients. These observations provided
      biological evidence of tongue diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine, and
      indicated that tongue-coating microbiome could be a potential non-invasive
      biomarker, which might be suitable for long-term monitoring of gastritis.

TI  - Characterisation of the British honey bee metagenome.
PG  - 4995

AB  - The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) plays a major role in pollination and
      food production. Honey bee health is a complex product of the environment, host
      genetics and associated microbes (commensal, opportunistic and pathogenic).
      Improved understanding of these factors will help manage modern challenges to bee
      health. Here we used DNA sequencing to characterise the genomes and metagenomes
      of 19 honey bee colonies from across Britain. Low heterozygosity was observed in 
      many Scottish colonies which had high similarity to the native dark bee. Colonies
      exhibited high diversity in composition and relative abundance of individual
      microbiome taxa. Most non-bee sequences were derived from known honey bee
      commensal bacteria or pathogens. However, DNA was also detected from additional
      fungal, protozoan and metazoan species. To classify cobionts lacking genomic
      information, we developed a novel network analysis approach for clustering orphan
      DNA contigs. Our analyses shed light on microbial communities associated with
      honey bees and demonstrate the power of high-throughput, directed metagenomics
      for identifying novel biological threats in agroecosystems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Macrolides are commonly prescribed for respiratory infections and
      asthma-like episodes in children. While their clinical benefits have been proved,
      concerns regarding the side-effects of their therapeutic use have been raised.
      Here we assess the short- and long-term impacts of azithromycin on the gut
      microbiota of young children. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial in a group of children aged 12-36months, diagnosed with 
      recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the COPSAC2010 cohort. Each acute asthma-like
      episode was randomized to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10mg/kg
      per day or placebo. Azithromycin reduced episode duration by half, which was the 
      primary end-point and reported previously. The assessment of gut microbiota after
      treatment was the secondary end-point and reported in this study. Fecal samples
      were collected 14days after randomization (N=59, short-term) and again at age
      4years (N=49, long-term, of whom N=18 were placebo treated) and investigated by
      16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. FINDINGS: Short-term, azithromycin caused a
      23% reduction in observed richness and 13% reduction in Shannon diversity.
      Microbiota composition was shifted primarily in the Actinobacteria phylum,
      especially a reduction of abundance in the genus Bifidobacterium. Long-term
      (13-39months after treatment), we did not observe any differences between the
      azithromycin and placebo recipients in their gut microbiota composition.
      INTERPRETATION: Azithromycin treatment induced a perturbation in the gut
      microbiota 14days after randomization but did not have long-lasting effects on
      the gut microbiota composition. However, it should be noted that our analyses
      included a limited number of fecal samples for the placebo treated group at age
      4years. FUND: Lundbeck Foundation, Danish Ministry of Health, Danish Council for

AB  - The accumulation of genomes of uncultured organisms has highlighted the need for 
      devising a taxonomic and nomenclature scheme to validate names and prevent
      redundancies. We here report on the recovery and analysis of four
      phylogenetically related genomes recovered from an anoxic sulfide and sulfur-rich
      spring (Zodletone spring) in southwestern Oklahoma. Phylogenetic analysis based
      on 120 single copy markers attested to their position as a novel distinct
      bacterial phylum. Genomic analysis suggests Gram-negative flagellated organisms
      that possess type IV pili. The organisms are predicted to be rod-shaped,
      slow-growers, with an anoxic, heterotrophic, and fermentative lifestyle.
      Predicted substrate utilization pattern includes multiple amino acids,
      dipeptides, tripeptides, and oligpopeptides; as well as few sugars. Predicted
      auxotrophies include proline, vitamin B6, lipoic acid, biotin, and vitamin B12.
      Assessment of the putative global distribution pattern of this novel lineage
      suggests its preference to anoxic marine, terrestrial, hydrocarbon-impacted, and 
      freshwater habitats. We propose the candidatus name Krumholzibacterium
      zodletonense gen. nov, sp. nov. for Zgenome0171(T), with the genome serving as
      the type material for the novel family Krumholzibacteriaceae fam. nov., order
      Krumholzibacteriales ord. nov., class Krumholzibacteria class nov., and phylum
      Krumholzibacteriota phyl. nov. The type material genome assembly is deposited in 
      GenBank under accession number QTKG01000000.

TI  - Similar Levels of Antimicrobial Resistance in U.S. Food Service Ground Beef
      Products with and without a "Raised without Antibiotics" Claim.
PG  - 2007-2018
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-299 [doi]
AB  - U.S. ground beef with "raised without antibiotics" (RWA) label claims are
      perceived as harboring fewer bacteria with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) than
      are found in conventional (CONV) ground beef with no such label claim. A total of
      370 ground beef samples from CONV ( n = 191) and RWA ( n = 179) production
      systems were collected over 13 months from three food service suppliers. The
      following bacteria were cultured: Escherichia coli, tetracycline-resistant
      (TET(r)) E. coli, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC(r)) E. coli,
      Salmonella enterica, TET(r) S. enterica, 3GC(r) S. enterica, nalidixic
      acid-resistant S. enterica, Enterococcus spp., erythromycin-resistant
      Enterococcus spp., TET(r) Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus. TET(r) E. coli was more frequently detected in
      CONV ground beef (CONV, 54.2%; RWA, 35.2%; P < 0.01), but supplier ( P < 0.01)
      and production system x suppler interaction ( P < 0.01) effects were also
      significant. Metagenomic DNA was isolated from each sample, and equal amounts of 
      metagenomic DNA were pooled by supplier, month, and production system for 75
      pooled samples (38 CONV, 37 RWA). The abundance of aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, aadA1,
      blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M, blaKPC-2, erm(B), mecA, tet(A), tet(B), and tet(M) genes was 
      assessed by quantitative PCR. The tet(A) (2.9-log2-fold change, P = 0.04) and
      tet(B) (5.6-log2-fold change) ( P = 0.03) genes were significantly more abundant 
      in RWA ground beef. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that ground beef microbiomes
      differed more by supplier than by production system. These results were
      consistent with prior research suggesting antimicrobial use in U.S. beef cattle
      has minimal impact on the AMR of bacteria found in these products. These results 
      should spur a reevaluation of assumptions regarding the impact of antimicrobial
      use during U.S. beef production on the AMR of bacteria in ground beef.

TI  - GenCoF: a graphical user interface to rapidly remove human genome contaminants
      from metagenomic datasets.
PG  - 2318-2319
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty963 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: The removal of human genomic reads from shotgun metagenomic sequencing
      is a critical step in protecting subject privacy. Freely available tools
      addressing this issue require advanced programing knowledge or are limited by
      analytical time and data load due to their server-based nature. Here, we compared
      the most cited tools for host-DNA removal using synthetic and real metagenomic
      datasets. Then, we integrated the most efficient pipeline in a graphical user
      interface to make these tools available without command line use. This interface,
      GenCoF, rapidly removes human genome contaminants from metagenomic datasets.
      Additionally, the tool offers quality-filtering, data reduction and interactive
      modification of any parameter in order to customize the analysis. GenCoF offers
      both quality and host-associated filtering in a non-commercial, freely available 
      tool in a local, interactive and easy-to-use interface. AVAILABILITY AND
      IMPLEMENTATION: GenCoF is freely available (under a GPL license) for Mac OS and
      Linux at https://github.com/MattCzajkowski/GenCoF. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
      Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Diazotrophic microbial community and abundance in acidic subtropical natural and 
      re-vegetated forest soils revealed by high-throughput sequencing of nifH gene.
PG  - 995-1005
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9466-7 [doi]
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is an important natural biochemical process
      converting the inert dinitrogen gas (N2) in the atmosphere to ammonia (NH3) in
      the N cycle. In this study, the nifH gene was chosen to detect the diazotrophic
      microorganisms with high-throughput sequencing from five acidic forest soils,
      including three natural forests and two re-vegetated forests. Soil samples were
      taken in two seasons (summer and winter) at two depth layers (surface and lower
      depths). A dataset of 179,600 reads obtained from 20 samples were analyzed to
      provide the microbial community structure, diversity, abundance, and relationship
      with physiochemical parameters. Both archaea and bacteria were detected in these 
      samples and diazotrophic bacteria were the dominant members contributing to the
      biological dinitrogen fixation in the acidic forest soils. Cyanobacteria,
      Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirocheates, and Verrucomicrobia were observed,
      especially the Proteobacteria as the most abundant phylum. The core genera were
      Bradyrhizobium and Methylobacterium from alpha-Proteobacteia, and Desulfovibrio
      from delta-Proteobacteia in the phylum of Proteobacteia of these samples. The
      diversity indices and the gene abundances of all samples were higher in the
      surface layer than the lower layer. Diversity was apparently higher in
      re-vegetated forests than the natural forests. Significant positive correlation
      to the organic matter and nitrogen-related parameters was observed, but there was
      no significant seasonal variation on the community structure and diversity in
      these samples between the summer and winter. The application of high-throughput
      sequencing method provides a better understanding and more comprehensive
      information of diazotrophs in acidic forest soils than conventional and PCR-based
      ones.

TI  - Modelling of zero-inflation improves inference of metagenomic gene count data.
PG  - 3712-3728
LID - 10.1177/0962280218811354 [doi]
AB  - Metagenomics enables the study of gene abundances in complex mixtures of
      microorganisms and has become a standard methodology for the analysis of the
      human microbiome. However, gene abundance data is inherently noisy and contains
      high levels of biological and technical variability as well as an excess of zeros
      due to non-detected genes. This makes the statistical analysis challenging. In
      this study, we present a new hierarchical Bayesian model for inference of
      metagenomic gene abundance data. The model uses a zero-inflated overdispersed
      Poisson distribution which is able to simultaneously capture the high
      gene-specific variability as well as zero observations in the data. By analysis
      of three comprehensive datasets, we show that zero-inflation is common in
      metagenomic data from the human gut and, if not correctly modelled, it can lead
      to substantial reductions in statistical power. We also show, by using resampled 
      metagenomic data, that our model has, compared to other methods, a higher and
      more stable performance for detecting differentially abundant genes. We conclude 
      that proper modelling of the gene-specific variability, including the excess of
      zeros, is necessary to accurately describe gene abundances in metagenomic data.
      The proposed model will thus pave the way for new biological insights into the
      structure of microbial communities.

AB  - Understanding the role of microbes in the solubility of cadmium (Cd) is of
      fundamental importance for remediation of Cd toxicity. The present study aimed to
      identify the microbes that involved in regulating Cd solubility and to reveal
      possible mechanisms. Therefore, microbial communities were investigated through
      high-throughput sequencing approach, the molecular ecological network was
      constructed and metagenomes were predicted. Our results indicated that redox
      conditions affected both the solubility of soil Cd and the microbial communities.
      Anaerobic microbes, such as Anaerolineaceae, did not only play important roles in
      shaping the microbial community in soils, but might also be involved in
      regulating the Cd solubility. Two possible mechanisms that how Anaerolineaceae
      involved in Cd solubility are (1) Anaerolineaceae are important organic matter
      degraders under anoxic conditions and (2) Anaerolineaceae can co-exist with
      methane metabolism microbes, while methane metabolism promotes the precipitation 
      of soluble Cd. Thus, application of Anaerolineaceae in bioremediation of soil
      Cadmium contamination is a potential approach. The study provided a novel insight
      into the role of microbial community in the regulation of Cd solubility under
      different redox conditions, and suggested a potential approach for the
      remediation of soil Cd contamination.

      high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome model.
PG  - 339-355

AB  - Sound evidence supports a role for interleukin-17 (IL-17) -producing gammadelta T
      cells and IL-17-producing helper T (Th17) cells in intestinal homeostasis,
      especially in intestinal barrier integrity. In the present study, we aimed to
      evaluate the role of IL-17 cytokine in the regulation of intestinal immunity and 
      obesity-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) in an experimental murine model.
      C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the IL-17 cytokine receptor
      (IL-17RA(-/-) ) were fed either a control diet (CD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 
      9 weeks. Our data demonstrate that IL-17RA(-/-) mice are protected against
      obesity, but develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. In
      parallel, HFD-fed IL-17RA(-/-) mice display intense inflammation in the ileum
      compared with WT mice on the HFD. IL-17RA(-/-) mice fed the HFD exhibit impaired 
      neutrophil migration to the intestinal mucosa and reduced gene expression of the 
      CXCL-1 chemokine and CXCR-2 receptor in the ileum. Interestingly, the populations
      of neutrophils (CD11b(+) Ly6G(+) ) and anti-inflammatory macrophages (CD11b(+)
      CX3CR1(+) ) are increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes of these mice.
      IL-17RA(-/-) mice on the HFD also display increased commensal bacterial
      translocation into the bloodstream and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels
      in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Metagenomic analysis of bacterial 16S gene 
      revealed increased Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla, the main
      representatives of Gram-negative bacteria, and reduced Akkermansia muciniphila in
      the fecal samples of IL-17RA(-/-) mice fed the HFD. Together, these data indicate
      that the IL-17/IL-17R axis drives intestinal neutrophil migration, limits gut
      dysbiosis and attenuates LPS translocation to VAT, resulting in protection to
      MetS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacteriome and virome alterations are associated with colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, the gut fungal microbiota in CRC remains largely
      unexplored. We aimed to characterise enteric mycobiome in CRC. DESIGN: Faecal
      shotgun metagenomic sequences of 184 patients with CRC, 197 patients with adenoma
      and 204 control subjects from Hong Kong were analysed (discovery cohort: 73
      patients with CRC and 92 control subjects; validation cohort: 111 patients with
      CRC, 197 patients with adenoma and 112 controls from Hong Kong). CRC-associated
      fungal markers and ecological changes were also validated in additional
      independent cohorts of 90 patients with CRC, 42 patients with adenoma and 66
      control subjects of published repository sequences from Germany and France.
      Assignment of taxonomies was performed by exact k-mer alignment against an
      integrated microbial reference genome database. RESULTS: Principal component
      analysis revealed separate clusters for CRC and control (p<0.0001), with distinct
      mycobiomes in early-stage and late-stage CRC (p=0.0048). Basidiomycota:Ascomycota
      ratio was higher in CRC (p=0.0042), with increase in Malasseziomycetes (p<0.0001)
      and decrease in Saccharomycetes (p<0.0001) and Pneumocystidomycetes (p=0.0017).
      Abundances of 14 fungal biomarkers distinguished CRC from controls with an area
      under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 and validated
      AUCs of 0.82 and 0.74 in independent Chinese cohort V1 and European cohort V2,
      respectively. Further ecological analysis revealed higher numbers of co-occurring
      fungal intrakingdom and co-exclusive bacterial-fungal correlations in CRC
      (p<0.0001). Moreover, co-occurrence interactions between fungi and bacteria,
      mostly contributed by fungal Ascomycota and bacterial Proteobacteria in control, 
      were reverted to co-exclusive interplay in CRC (p=0.00045). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study revealed CRC-associated mycobiome dysbiosis characterised by altered fungal
      composition and ecology, signifying that the gut mycobiome might play a role in
      CRC.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis in the aquatic environment has emerged as a
      promising tool for diagnosis of the ecological status in comprehensive monitoring
      strategies and might become useful in context of the European Water Framework
      Directive (WFD) and other legislations to derive stressor-specific indicators.
      Despite many studies having made significant progress for the future use of eDNA 
      in terms of ecosystem composition and detection of invasive/rare species in
      inland waters, much remains unknown about the transport and fate of eDNA under
      natural environmental conditions. We designed a specific dual-labelled probe to
      detect brown trout (Salmo trutta, L.) eDNA and used the probe to describe the
      fate of eDNA released from an aquaculture facility into the low mountain range
      stream Wehebach, Germany. The probe was shown to be specific to brown trout, as
      ponds housing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) did not test positive. Even
      though we observed different strengths of eDNA signals for three ponds containing
      different brown trout quantities, no significant correlation was found between
      biomass (kg/L) and eDNA quantity. Our results indicate that the release of DNA
      from brown trout might be life stage and/or age-dependent. The effluents of the
      aquaculture facility were a source of high levels of eDNA which resulted in the
      greatest abundance of brown trout eDNA directly downstream of the facility.
      Despite the natural occurrence of brown trout in the Wehebach, as shown by
      ecological investigations conducted by authorities of the federal state of North 
      Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and personal observations, we observed a significant
      decrease of relative abundance of eDNA in the Wehebach within the first 1.5km
      downstream of the aquaculture. Our results suggest that concentrations of eDNA in
      running waters rapidly decrease under natural conditions due to dilution and
      degradation processes, which might have important implications for the utility of
      eDNA in environmental research.

TI  - The population genomics of multiple tsetse fly (Glossina fuscipes fuscipes)
      admixture zones in Uganda.
PG  - 66-85
LID - 10.1111/mec.14957 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that enforce, maintain or reverse the process of
      speciation is an important challenge in evolutionary biology. This study
      investigates the patterns of divergence and discusses the processes that form and
      maintain divergent lineages of the tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in
      Uganda. We sampled 251 flies from 18 sites spanning known genetic lineages and
      the four admixture zones between them. We apply population genomics, hybrid zone 
      and approximate Bayesian computation to the analysis of three types of genetic
      markers: 55,267 double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) SNPs to
      assess genome-wide admixture, 16 microsatellites to provide continuity with
      published data and accurate biogeographic modelling, and a 491-bp fragment of
      mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and II to infer maternal inheritance patterns.
      Admixture zones correspond with regions impacted by the reorganization of
      Uganda's river networks that occurred during the formation of the West African
      Rift system over the last several hundred thousand years. Because tsetse fly
      population distributions are defined by rivers, admixture zones likely represent 
      both old and new regions of secondary contact. Our results indicate that older
      hybrid zones contain mostly parental types, while younger zones contain variable 
      hybrid types resulting from multiple generations of interbreeding. These findings
      suggest that reproductive barriers are nearly complete in the older admixture
      zones, while nearly absent in the younger admixture zones. Findings are
      consistent with predictions of hybrid zone theory: Populations in zones of
      secondary contact transition rapidly from early to late stages of speciation or
      collapse all together.

TI  - Diversity and predictive metabolic pathways of the prokaryotic microbial
      community along a groundwater salinity gradient of the Pearl River Delta, China.
PG  - 17317
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-35350-2 [doi]
AB  - Almost half of the groundwater in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) contains salt water
      originally derived from paleo-seawater due to the Holocene transgression, which
      then generates intense physicochemical gradients in the mixing zone between
      freshwater and saltwater. Although some studies have been conducted on the
      hydrological and geochemical characteristics of groundwater in the PRD to monitor
      the intrusion of seawater, little attention has been paid to the microbial
      community of this particular region. In this study, we implemented a
      high-throughput sequencing analysis to characterize the microbial communities
      along a salinity gradient in the PRD aquifer, China. Our results indicated that
      the microbial community composition varied significantly depending on the
      salinity of the aquifer. The presence of abundant anaerobic microorganisms of the
      genera Desulfovibrio and Methanococcus in certain saltwater samples may be
      responsible for the gas generation of H2S and CH4 in the stratum. In saline water
      samples (TDS > 10 g/L), the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)
      analysis found two biomarkers that usually live in marine environments, and the
      aquifers of the PRD still contained large quantity of saltwater, indicating that 
      the impact of the paleo-seawater has lasted to this day. The predictive
      metagenomic analysis revealed that the metabolic pathways present in the
      groundwater samples studied, included the degradation of pesticides and
      refractory organics (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), atrazine and
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), matter cycling (methane, nitrogen and sulfur),
      and inorganic ion and mineral metabolites. This study can help enhance our
      understanding of the composition of the microbial assemblages and its
      implications as an environmental indicator in an aquifer affected by saltwater
      intrusion.

AB  - We developed Growth Rate InDex (GRiD) for estimating in situ growth rates of
      ultra-low coverage (>0.2x) and de novo-assembled metagenomes. Applying GRiD to
      human and environmental metagenomic datasets to demonstrate its versatility, we
      uncovered new associations with previously uncharacterized bacteria whose growth 
      rates were associated with several disease characteristics or environmental
      interactions. In addition, with GRiD-MG (metagenomic), a high-throughput
      implementation of GRiD, we estimated growth dynamics of 1756 bacteria species
      from a healthy skin metagenomic dataset and identified a new
      Staphylococcus-Corynebacterium antagonism likely mediated by antimicrobial
      production in the skin. GRiD-MG significantly increases the ability to extract
      growth rate inferences from complex metagenomic data with minimal input from the 
      user.

TI  - The so far farthest reaches of the double jelly roll capsid protein fold.
PG  - 181
LID - 10.1186/s12985-018-1097-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the last two decades, structural biology analyses have shown
      that viruses infecting hosts far apart in evolution share similar architectural
      features, prompting a new virus classification based on structural lineages.
      Until recently, only a few prokaryotic viruses had been described for one of the 
      lineages, whose main characteristic is a capsid protein with a perpendicular
      double jelly roll. MAIN BODY: Metagenomics analyses are showing that the variety 
      of prokaryotic viruses encoding double jelly roll capsid proteins is much larger 
      than previously thought. The newly discovered viruses have novel genome
      organisations with interesting implications for virus structure, function and
      evolution. There are also indications of their having a significant ecological
      impact. CONCLUSION: Viruses with double jelly roll capsid proteins that infect
      prokaryotic hosts form a large part of the virosphere that had so far gone
      unnoticed. Their discovery by metagenomics is only a first step towards many more
      exciting findings. Work needs to be invested in isolating these viruses and their
      hosts, characterizing the structure and function of the proteins their genomes
      encode, and eventually access the wealth of biological information they may hold.

TI  - Analysis of the gut-specific microbiome from field-captured tsetse flies, and its
      potential relevance to host trypanosome vector competence.
PG  - 146
LID - 10.1186/s12866-018-1284-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The tsetse fly (Glossina sp.) midgut is colonized by maternally
      transmitted and environmentally acquired bacteria. Additionally, the midgut
      serves as a niche in which pathogenic African trypanosomes reside within infected
      flies. Tsetse's bacterial microbiota impacts many aspects of the fly's
      physiology. However, little is known about the structure of tsetse's
      midgut-associated bacterial communities as they relate to geographically distinct
      fly habitats in east Africa and their contributions to parasite infection
      outcomes. We utilized culture dependent and independent methods to characterize
      the taxonomic structure and density of bacterial communities that reside within
      the midgut of tsetse flies collected at geographically distinct locations in
      Kenya and Uganda. RESULTS: Using culture dependent methods, we isolated 34
      strains of bacteria from four different tsetse species (G. pallidipes, G.
      brevipalpis, G. fuscipes and G. fuscipleuris) captured at three distinct
      locations in Kenya. To increase the depth of this study, we deep sequenced
      midguts from individual uninfected and trypanosome infected G. pallidipes
      captured at two distinct locations in Kenya and one in Uganda. We found that
      tsetse's obligate endosymbiont, Wigglesworthia, was the most abundant bacterium
      present in the midgut of G. pallidipes, and the density of this bacterium
      remained largely consistent regardless of whether or not its tsetse host was
      infected with trypanosomes. These fly populations also housed the commensal
      symbiont Sodalis, which was found at significantly higher densities in
      trypanosome infected compared to uninfected flies. Finally, midguts of
      field-captured G. pallidipes were colonized with distinct, low density
      communities of environmentally acquired microbes that differed in taxonomic
      structure depending on parasite infection status and the geographic location from
      which the flies were collected. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will
      enhance our understanding of the tripartite relationship between tsetse, its
      microbiota and trypanosome vector competence. This information may be useful for 
      developing novel disease control strategies or enhancing the efficacy of those
      already in use.

TI  - Characterization of Arginine Catabolism by Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from
      Kimchi.
LID - E3049 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules23113049 [doi]
AB  - Kimchi fermentation depends on diverse lactic acid bacteria, which convert raw
      materials into numerous metabolites that contribute to the taste of food. Amino
      acids and saccharides are important primary metabolites. Arginine is nearly
      exhausted during kimchi fermentation, whereas the concentrations of other amino
      acids are reported not to increase or decrease dramatically. These phenomena
      could imply that arginine is an important nutritional component among the amino
      acids during kimchi fermentation. In this study, we investigated the
      arginine-catabolism pathway of seven lactic acid bacteria isolated from kimchi
      and evaluated the products of arginine catabolism (citrulline and ornithine)
      associated with the bacteria. The arginine content dramatically decreased in
      cultures of Lactobacillus brevis and Weissella confusa from 300 mug/mL of
      arginine to 0.14 +/- 0.19 and 1.3 +/- 0.01 mug/mL, respectively, after 6 h of
      cultivation. Citrulline and ornithine production by L. brevis and W. confusa
      showed a pattern that was consistent with arginine catabolism. Interestingly,
      Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and 
      Leuconostoc lactis did not show increased citrulline levels after arginine was
      added. The ornithine contents were higher in all bacteria except for L. lactis
      after adding arginine to the culture. These results were consistent with the
      absence of the arginine deiminase gene among the lactic acid bacteria. Arginine
      consumption and ornithine production were monitored and compared with lactic acid
      bacteria by metagenomics analysis, which showed that the increment of ornithine
      production correlated positively with lactic acid bacteria growth.

AB  - The composition of gastrointestinal tract viromes has been associated with
      multiple diseases. Our understanding of virus communities in the GI tract is
      still very limited due to challenges in sampling from different GI sites. Here we
      defined the GI viromes of 15 rhesus macaques with chronic diarrhea. Luminal
      content samples from terminal ileum, proximal and distal colon were collected at 
      necropsy while samples from the rectum were collected antemortem using a fecal
      loop. The composition of and ecological parameters associated with the terminal
      ileum virome were distinct from the colon and rectum samples; these differences
      were driven by bacteriophages rather than eukaryotic viruses. The six contigs
      that were most discriminative of the viromes were distantly related to
      bacteriophages from three different families. Our analysis provides support for
      using fecal loop sampling of the rectum as a proxy of the colonic virome in
      humans.

AB  - Heat treatment alters the nutritive quality of camels' milk and thus the
      intestine microbiota, but the effect of heat treatment-induced nutrient loss on
      the functional features of the intestine microbiota is unknown. In this study,
      the influence of two heat treatments of camels' milk on the intestine microbiota 
      was investigated to establish the correlations between milk nutrients and the
      functional features of the intestine microbiota. Camels' milk, heat treated at
      low (65 degrees C) or high (100 degrees C) temperatures, was administered to mice
      (LM = low; HM = high); control mice received sterile distilled water (CW =
      control). Intestine microbiota were compared in the three groups using
      metagenomic-based 16S rRNA gene high throughput sequencing. The results showed
      that the relative abundance of probiotic genera (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and
      Lactobacillus) was significantly higher in the LM group mice than in the HM group
      mice, due to the high-temperature degradation of the nutrients of camels' milk.
      The diversity of the intestine microbiota in mice receiving milk was lower than
      in the control group because of the intrinsically high antimicrobial components
      (lactoferrin and lysozyme) detected in camels' milk. Carbohydrate
      digestion/absorption, and cysteine and methionine metabolism were significantly
      higher in the intestine microbiota of the LM group mice than in the HM group mice
      owing to the corresponding degradation of lactose, cysteine and methionine in
      camels' milk at high temperatures. Changes in the nutrients of camels' milk
      affected the changes in the functional features of the intestine microbiota. This
      research suggests that low temperature heat treatment achieves nutrient
      preservation, but also encourages probiotic genera.

AB  - Pseudouridimycin (PUM) is a novel pseudouridine-containing peptidyl-nucleoside
      antibiotic that inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) through a binding site
      and mechanism different from those of clinically approved RNAP inhibitors of the 
      rifamycin and lipiarmycin (fidaxomicin) classes. PUM was discovered by screening 
      microbial fermentation extracts for RNAP inhibitors. In this review, we describe 
      the discovery and characterization of PUM. We also describe the RNAP-inhibitory
      and antibacterial properties of PUM. Finally, we review available information on 
      the gene cluster and pathway for PUM biosynthesis and on the potential for
      discovering additional novel pseudouridine-containing nucleoside antibiotics by
      searching bacterial genome and metagenome sequences for sequences similar to
      pumJ, the pseudouridine-synthase gene of the PUM biosynthesis gene cluster.

      Communities of Kiwifruit Plants.
PG  - 1563
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2018.01563 [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is the causal agent of the bacterial
      canker, the most devastating disease of kiwifruit vines. Before entering the host
      tissues, this pathogen has an epiphytic growth phase on kiwifruit flowers and
      leaves, thus the ecological interactions within epiphytic bacterial community may
      greatly influence the onset of the infection process. The bacterial community
      associated to the two most important cultivated kiwifruit species, Actinidia
      chinensis and Actinidia deliciosa, was described both on flowers and leaves using
      Illumina massive parallel sequencing of the V3 and V4 variable regions of the 16S
      rRNA gene. In addition, the effect of plant infection by Psa on the epiphytic
      bacterial community structure and biodiversity was investigated. Psa infection
      affected the phyllosphere microbiome structures in both species, however, its
      impact was more pronounced on A. deliciosa leaves, where a drastic drop in
      microbial biodiversity was observed. Furthermore, we also showed that Psa was
      always present in syndemic association with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and
      Pseudomonas viridiflava, two other kiwifruit pathogens, suggesting the
      establishment of a pathogenic consortium leading to a higher pathogenesis
      capacity. Finally, the analyses of the dynamics of bacterial populations provided
      useful information for the screening and selection of potential biocontrol agents
      against Psa.

AB  - Future climate change has the potential to alter the distribution and prevalence 
      of plant pathogens, which may have significant implications for both agricultural
      crops and natural plant communities. However, there are few long-term datasets
      against which modelled predictions of pathogen responses to climate change can be
      tested. Here, we use 18S metabarcoding of 28 rodent middens (solidified deposits 
      of rodent coprolites and nesting material) from the Central Atacama, spanning the
      last ca. 49 ka, to provide the first long-term late Quaternary record of change
      in plant pathogen communities in response to changing climate. Plant pathogen
      richness was significantly greater in middens deposited during the Central Andean
      Pluvial Event (CAPE); a period of increased precipitation between 17.5-8.5 ka.
      Moreover, the occurrence frequency of Pucciniaceae (rust fungi) was significantly
      greater during the CAPE, and the highest relative abundances for five additional 
      potentially pathogenic taxa also occurred during this period. The results
      demonstrate the promising potential for ancient DNA analysis of late Quaternary
      samples to reveal insights into how plant pathogens responded to past climatic
      and environmental change, which could help predict how pathogens may responded to
      future change.

TI  - Impact of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate followed by Autologous Fecal Microbiota
      Transplantation on Fecal Microbiome Structure and Metabolic Potential.
LID - e00588-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSphereDirect.00588-18 [doi]
AB  - Strategies to prevent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are scarce, 
      but autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (autoFMT) may limit
      gastrointestinal MDRO expansion. AutoFMT involves banking one's feces during a
      healthy state for later use in restoring gut microbiota following perturbation.
      This pilot study evaluated the effect of autoFMT on gastrointestinal microbiome
      taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity after
      exposure to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Amox-Clav). Ten healthy participants
      were enrolled. All received 5 days of Amox-Clav. Half were randomized to autoFMT,
      derived from stool collected pre-antimicrobial exposure, by enema, and half to
      saline enema. Participants submitted stool samples pre- and post-Amox-Clav and
      enema and during a 90-day follow-up period. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing
      revealed taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity. 
      Amox-Clav significantly altered gut taxonomic composition in all participants (n 
      = 10, P < 0.01); however, only three participants exhibited major changes at the 
      phylum level following exposure. In the cohort as a whole, beta-lactamase genes
      were enriched following Amox-Clav (P < 0.05), and predicted metabolic capacity
      was significantly altered (P < 0.01). Species composition, metabolic capacity,
      and beta-lactamase abundance returned to pre-antimicrobial exposure state 7 days 
      after either autoFMT or saline enema (P > 0.05, compared to enrollment).
      Alterations to microbial metabolic capacity occurred following antimicrobial
      exposure even in participants without substantial taxonomic disruption,
      potentially creating open niches for pathogen colonization. Our findings suggest 
      that metabolic potential is an important consideration for complete assessment of
      antimicrobial impact on the microbiome. AutoFMT was well tolerated and may have
      contributed to phylogenetic recovery. (This study has been registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02046525.)IMPORTANCE The spread of
      multidrug resistance among pathogenic organisms threatens the efficacy of
      antimicrobial treatment options. The human gut serves as a reservoir for many
      drug-resistant organisms and their resistance genes, and perturbation of the gut 
      microbiome by antimicrobial exposure can open metabolic niches to resistant
      pathogens. Once established in the gut, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can
      persist even after antimicrobial exposure ceases. Strategies to prevent
      multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are scarce, but autologous fecal
      microbiota transplantation (autoFMT) may limit gastrointestinal MDRO expansion.
      AutoFMT involves banking one's feces during a healthy state for later use in
      restoring gut microbiota following perturbation. This pilot study evaluated the
      effect of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Amox-Clav) exposure and autoFMT on
      gastrointestinal microbiome taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and
      metabolic capacity. Importantly, we found that metabolic capacity was perturbed
      even in cases where gross phylogeny remained unchanged and that autoFMT was safe 
      and well tolerated.

TI  - Fecal virome composition of migratory wild duck species.
PG  - e0206970
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0206970 [doi]
AB  - The fecal virome comprises a complex diversity of eukaryotic viruses, phages and 
      viruses that infect the host. However, little is known about the intestinal
      community of viruses that is present in wild waterfowl, and the structure of this
      community in wild ducks has not yet been studied. The fecal virome compositions
      of six species of wild dabbling ducks and one species of wild diving duck were
      thus analyzed. Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectums of 60 ducks
      donated by hunters. DNA and RNA virus particles were purified and sequenced using
      the MiSeq Illumina platform. The reads obtained from the sequencing were analyzed
      and compared with sequences in the GenBank database. Viral-related sequences from
      the Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae and Myoviridae
      viral families showed the highest overall abundances in the samples. The virome
      analysis identified viruses that had not been found in wild duck feces and
      revealed distinct virome profiles between different species and between samples
      of the same species. This study increases our understanding of viruses in wild
      ducks as possible viral reservoirs and provides a basis for further studying and 
      monitoring the transmission of viruses from wild animals to humans and disease
      outbreaks in domestic animals.

AB  - Biological nitrogen removal processes based on partial nitrification are
      promising for ammonium-rich wastewater treatment. In this study, a partial
      nitrification-denitrification double sludge system was applied to treat synthetic
      ammonium-rich wastewater. Metagenomic analysis of functional genes and metabolic 
      pathways was conducted, also with the evaluation of system performance and
      nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. In the nitrifying sequencing batch reactor (SBRPN),
      the removal percentage of ammonium nitrogen reached to 99.98% with a high
      nitritation efficiency of 93.24%, and the N2O emission factor was 0.88%. In the
      denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (SBRDN), there was almost no nitrate
      nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen in the effluent, and the maximum N2O emission was
      0.078 mg N/L. The dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria was Nitrosomonas in SBRPN
      (13.6%), and the main potential denitrifiers in SBRDN were Thauera (14.6%), an
      uncultured genus in the Comamonadaceae family (4.0%), an uncultured genus in
      Rhodocyclaceae family (2.4%) and Comamonas (1.1%). Metagenomic analysis revealed 
      that amo mainly distributed in Nitrosomonas eutropha (38.3%), Nitrosomonas
      europaea (27.1%), Nitrosomonas sp. GH22 (20.5%) and Nitrosomonas sp. TK794
      (15.0%), and Bacteroidetes had the N2O reduction potential in SBRPN.

TI  - Distinct roles of histamine H1- and H2-receptor signaling pathways in
      inflammation-associated colonic tumorigenesis.
PG  - G205-G216
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00212.2018 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a well-known risk factor for the development 
      of colorectal cancer. Prior studies have demonstrated that microbial histamine
      can ameliorate intestinal inflammation in mice. We tested the hypothesis whether 
      microbe-derived luminal histamine suppresses inflammation-associated colon cancer
      in Apc(min/+) mice. Mice were colonized with the human-derived Lactobacillus
      reuteri. Chronic inflammation was induced by repeated cycles of low-dose dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice that were given histamine-producing L. reuteri via
      oral gavage developed fewer colonic tumors, despite the presence of a complex
      mouse gut microbiome. We further demonstrated that administration of a histamine 
      H1-receptor (H1R) antagonist suppressed tumorigenesis, while administration of
      histamine H2-receptor (H2R) antagonist significantly increased both tumor number 
      and size. The bimodal functions of histamine include protumorigenic effects
      through H1R and antitumorigenic effects via H2R, and these results were supported
      by gene expression profiling studies on tumor specimens of patients with
      colorectal cancer. Greater ratios of gene expression of H2R ( HRH2) vs. H1R (
      HRH1) were correlated with improved overall survival outcomes in patients with
      colorectal cancer. Additionally, activation of H2R suppressed phosphorylation of 
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inhibited chemokine gene expression
      induced by H1R activation in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, the combination
      of a H1R antagonist and a H2R agonist yielded potent suppression of
      lipopolysaccharide-induced MAPK signaling in macrophages. Given the impact on
      intestinal epithelial and immune cells, simultaneous modulation of H1R and H2R
      signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and
      treatment of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. NEW & NOTEWORTHY
      Histamine-producing Lactobacillus reuteri can suppress development of
      inflammation-associated colon cancer in an established mouse model. The net
      effects of histamine may depend on the relative activity of H1R and H2R signaling
      pathways in the intestinal mucosa. Our findings suggest that treatment with H1R
      or H2R antagonists could yield opposite effects. However, by harnessing the
      ability to block H1R signaling while stimulating H2R signaling, novel strategies 
      for suppression of intestinal inflammation and colorectal neoplasia could be
      developed.

AB  - MOTIVATION: The application of constraint-based modeling to functionally analyze 
      metagenomic data has been limited so far, partially due to the absence of
      suitable toolboxes. RESULTS: To address this gap, we created a comprehensive
      toolbox to model (i) microbe-microbe and host-microbe metabolic interactions, and
      (ii) microbial communities using microbial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions
      and metagenomic data. The Microbiome Modeling Toolbox extends the functionality
      of the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis toolbox. AVAILABILITY AND
      IMPLEMENTATION: The Microbiome Modeling Toolbox and the tutorials at

AB  - Factors that affect the respiration of organic carbon by marine bacteria can
      alter the extent to which the oceans act as a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
      We designed seawater dilution experiments to assess the effect of pCO2 enrichment
      on heterotrophic bacterial community composition and metabolic potential in
      response to a pulse of phytoplankton-derived organic carbon. Experiments included
      treatments of elevated (1000 p.p.m.) and low (250 p.p.m.) pCO2 amended with 10
      mumol L(-1) dissolved organic carbon from Emiliana huxleyi lysates, and were
      conducted using surface-seawater collected from the South Pacific Subtropical
      Gyre. To assess differences in community composition and metabolic potential,
      shotgun metagenomic libraries were sequenced from low and elevated pCO2
      treatments collected at the start of the experiment and following exponential
      growth. Our results indicate bacterial communities changed markedly in response
      to the organic matter pulse over time and were significantly affected by pCO2
      enrichment. Elevated pCO2 also had disproportionate effects on the abundance of
      sequences related to proton pumps, carbohydrate metabolism, modifications of the 
      phospholipid bilayer, resistance to toxic compounds and conjugative transfer.
      These results contribute to a growing understanding of the effects of elevated
      pCO2 on bacteria-mediated carbon cycling during phytoplankton bloom conditions in
      the marine environment.

      Water Samples Related to Swine Feedlot Wastewater Treatment.
PG  - 2474

AB  - In this study, we examined the types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
      possessed by bacteria and bacteriophages in swine feedlot wastewater before and
      after treatment using a metagenomics approach. We found that the relative
      abundance of ARGs in bacterial DNA in all water samples was significantly higher 
      than that in phages DNA (>10.6-fold), and wastewater treatment did not
      significantly change the relative abundance of bacterial- or phage-associated
      ARGs. We further detected the distribution and diversity of the different types
      of ARGs according to the class of antibiotics to which they confer resistance,
      the tetracycline resistance genes were the most abundant resistance genes and
      phages were more likely to harbor ATP-binding cassette transporter family and
      ribosomal protection genes. Moreover, the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was also
      detected in the phage population. When assessing the contribution of phages in
      spreading different groups of ARGs, beta-lactamase resistance genes had a
      relatively high spreading ability even though the abundance was low. These
      findings possibly indicated that phages not only could serve as important
      reservoir of ARG but also carry particular ARGs in swine feedlot wastewater, and 
      this phenomenon is independent of the environment.

LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07343-2 [doi]
AB  - Citrus is a globally important, perennial fruit crop whose rhizosphere microbiome
      is thought to play an important role in promoting citrus growth and health. Here,
      we report a comprehensive analysis of the structural and functional composition
      of the citrus rhizosphere microbiome. We use both amplicon and deep shotgun
      metagenomic sequencing of bulk soil and rhizosphere samples collected across
      distinct biogeographical regions from six continents. Predominant taxa include
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The core citrus 
      rhizosphere microbiome comprises Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Cupriavidus,
      Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Burkholderia, Cellvibrio, Sphingomonas,
      Variovorax and Paraburkholderia, some of which are potential plant beneficial
      microbes. We also identify over-represented microbial functional traits mediating
      plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, nutrition acquisition and plant
      growth promotion in citrus rhizosphere. The results provide valuable information 
      to guide microbial isolation and culturing and, potentially, to harness the power
      of the microbiome to improve plant production and health.

TI  - Quantitative metaproteomics of medieval dental calculus reveals individual oral
      health status.
PG  - 4744
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07148-3 [doi]
AB  - The composition of ancient oral microbiomes has recently become accessible owing 
      to advanced biomolecular methods such as metagenomics and metaproteomics, but the
      utility of metaproteomics for such analyses is less explored. Here, we use
      quantitative metaproteomics to characterize the dental calculus associated with
      the remains of 21 humans retrieved during the archeological excavation of the
      medieval (ca. 1100-1450 CE) cemetery of Tjaerby, Denmark. We identify 3671
      protein groups, covering 220 bacterial species and 81 genera across all medieval 
      samples. The metaproteome profiles of bacterial and human proteins suggest two
      distinct groups of archeological remains corresponding to health-predisposed and 
      oral disease-susceptible individuals, which is supported by comparison to the
      calculus metaproteomes of healthy living individuals. Notably, the groupings
      identified by metaproteomics are not apparent from the bioarchaeological
      analysis, illustrating that quantitative metaproteomics has the potential to
      provide additional levels of molecular information about the oral health status
      of individuals from archeological contexts.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding of faecal samples is being successfully used to study the
      foraging niche of species. We assessed the ability of two benchtop
      high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms, to identify a large taxonomic array
      of food items from domestic cats Felis silvestris catus, including prey and
      human-related food taxa (pet food and leftovers leaving undetectable solid
      remains in faeces). Scats from a captive feeding trial (n = 41) and from
      free-ranging individuals (n = 326) were collected and analysed using a cytb
      mini-barcode in independent PCR replicates on the Ion PGM and the MiSeq
      platforms. Outputs from MiSeq were more sensitive and reproducible than those
      from Ion PGM due to a higher sequencing depth and sequence quality on MiSeq. DNA 
      from intact prey taxa was detected more often (82% of the expected occurrences)
      than DNA from pet food (54%) and raw fish and meat (31%). We assumed that this
      variability was linked to different degree of DNA degradation: The Ion PGM
      detected significantly less human-linked food, birds, field voles, murids and
      shrews in the field-collected samples than the MiSeq platform. Pooling the
      replicates from both platforms and filtering the data allowed identification of
      at least one food item in 87.4% of the field-collected samples. Our DNA
      metabarcoding approach identified 29 prey taxa, of which 25 to species level (90%
      of items) including 9 rodents, 3 insectivores, 12 birds and 1 reptile and 33
      human-related food taxa of which 23 were identified to genus level (75% of
      items). Our results demonstrate that using HTS platforms such as MiSeq, which
      provide reads of sufficiently high quantity and quality, with sufficient numbers 
      of technical replicates, is a robust and non-invasive approach for further
      dietary studies on animals foraging on a wide range of food items in
      anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - Human viruses (those that infect human cells) have been associated with many
      cancers, largely due to their mutagenic and functionally manipulative abilities. 
      Despite this, cancer microbiome studies have focused almost exclusively on
      bacteria instead of viruses. We began evaluating the cancer virome by focusing on
      colorectal cancer, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the
      world and a cancer linked to altered colonic bacterial community compositions but
      with an unknown association with the gut virome. We used 16S rRNA gene, whole
      shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing of stool to
      evaluate the differences in human colorectal cancer virus and bacterial community
      composition. Through random forest modeling, we identified differences in the
      healthy and colorectal cancer viromes. The cancer-associated virome consisted
      primarily of temperate bacteriophages that were also predicted to be
      bacterium-virus community network hubs. These results provide foundational
      evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and
      potentially impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host
      communities.IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
      death in the United States and worldwide. Its risk and severity have been linked 
      to colonic bacterial community composition. Although human-specific viruses have 
      been linked to other cancers and diseases, little is known about colorectal
      cancer virus communities. We addressed this knowledge gap by identifying
      differences in colonic virus communities in the stool of colorectal cancer
      patients and how they compared to bacterial community differences. The results
      suggested an indirect role for the virome in impacting colorectal cancer by
      modulating the associated bacterial community. These findings both support the
      idea of a biological role for viruses in colorectal cancer and provide a new
      understanding of basic colorectal cancer etiology.

TI  - A comprehensive fungi-specific 18S rRNA gene sequence primer toolkit suited for
      diverse research issues and sequencing platforms.
PG  - 190
LID - 10.1186/s12866-018-1331-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several fungi-specific primers target the 18S rRNA gene sequence, one
      of the prominent markers for fungal classification. The design of most primers
      goes back to the last decades. Since then, the number of sequences in public
      databases increased leading to the discovery of new fungal groups and changes in 
      fungal taxonomy. However, no reevaluation of primers was carried out and relevant
      information on most primers is missing. With this study, we aimed to develop an
      18S rRNA gene sequence primer toolkit allowing an easy selection of the best
      primer pair appropriate for different sequencing platforms, research aims
      (biodiversity assessment versus isolate classification) and target groups.
      RESULTS: We performed an intensive literature research, reshuffled existing
      primers into new pairs, designed new Illumina-primers, and annealing blocking
      oligonucleotides. A final number of 439 primer pairs were subjected to in silico 
      PCRs. Best primer pairs were selected and experimentally tested. The most
      promising primer pair with a small amplicon size, nu-SSU-1333-5'/nu-SSU-1647-3'
      (FF390/FR-1), was successful in describing fungal communities by Illumina
      sequencing. Results were confirmed by a simultaneous metagenomics and
      eukaryote-specific primer approach. Co-amplification occurred in all sample types
      but was effectively reduced by blocking oligonucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: The
      compiled data revealed the presence of an enormous diversity of fungal 18S rRNA
      gene primer pairs in terms of fungal coverage, phylum spectrum and
      co-amplification. Therefore, the primer pair has to be carefully selected to
      fulfill the requirements of the individual research projects. The presented
      primer toolkit offers comprehensive lists of 164 primers, 439 primer
      combinations, 4 blocking oligonucleotides, and top primer pairs holding all
      relevant information including primer's characteristics and performance to
      facilitate primer pair selection.

AB  - Pulp wash was used as substrate for the activity of ligninolytic enzymes of the
      fungus Pleurotus sajor-caju. Activity of laccase (Lac) and manganese peroxidase
      (MnP) as well as fungal biomass occurred under four conditions: different pulp
      wash concentrations, pH variation at the optimal pulp wash concentration,
      different glucose concentrations, and different concentrations of ammonium
      nitrate. The best enzyme activity and biomass production were obtained with in
      natura pulp wash and pH corrected to 5.0 (4884 IU/L Lac; 82 IU/L MnP; 25 g/100 mL
      biomass). However, the addition of glucose and ammonium nitrate to the pulp wash 
      was not necessary for increasing the enzyme activity and biomass production.
      Efficient removal of pulp wash chemical oxygen demand (99.66%) and biochemical
      oxygen demand (83.27%) occurred after the mycoremediation with P. sajor-caju in
      the optimized conditions. Lactuca sativa L. seeds germination bioassay showed a
      four-fold reduction in the residue toxicity (EC50 28.72%) after the treatment
      with the fungus. Our findings are consistent with the notion that pulp wash is an
      excellent substrate for inducing the activity of ligninolytic enzymes and
      producing fungal biomass, and that the biological treatment is efficient to
      reduce effluent toxicity.

TI  - The genome of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma solani' strain SA-1 is highly dynamic and
      prone to adopting foreign sequences.

AB  - Bacteria of the genus 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' are uncultivated intracellular
      plant pathogens transmitted by phloem-feeding insects. They have small genomes
      lacking genes for essential metabolites, which they acquire from either plant or 
      insect hosts. Nonetheless, some phytoplasmas, such as 'Ca. P. solani', have broad
      plant host range and are transmitted by several polyphagous insect species. To
      understand better how these obligate symbionts can colonize such a wide range of 
      hosts, the genome of 'Ca. P. solani' strain SA-1 was sequenced from infected
      periwinkle via a metagenomics approach. The de novo assembly generated a draft
      genome with 19 contigs totalling 821,322bp, which corresponded to more than 80%
      of the estimated genome size. Further completion of the genome was challenging
      due to the high occurrence of repetitive sequences. The majority of repeats
      consisted of gene arrangements characteristic of phytoplasma potential mobile
      units (PMUs). These regions showed variation in gene orders intermixed with genes
      of unknown functions and lack of similarity to other phytoplasma genes,
      suggesting that they were prone to rearrangements and acquisition of new
      sequences via recombination. The availability of this high-quality draft genome
      also provided a foundation for genome-scale genotypic analysis (e.g., average
      nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity) and molecular phylogenetic
      analysis. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence of horizontal transfer for
      PMU-like elements from various phytoplasmas, including distantly related ones.
      The 'Ca. P. solani' SA-1 genome also contained putative secreted protein/effector
      genes, including a homologue of SAP11, found in many other phytoplasma species.

TI  - Metagenomics of pasteurized and unpasteurized gouda cheese using targeted 16S
      rDNA sequencing.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12866-018-1323-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiome of cheese is diverse, even within a variety. The
      metagenomics of cheese is dependent on a vast array of biotic and abiotic
      factors. Biotic factors include the population of microbiota and their resulting 
      cellular metabolism. Abiotic factors, including the pH, water activity, fat,
      salt, and moisture content of the cheese matrix, as well as environmental
      conditions (temperature, humidity, and location of aging), influence the biotic
      factors. This study assessed the metagenomics of commercial Gouda cheese prepared
      using pasteurized or unpasteurized cow milk or pasteurized goat milk via 16S rDNA
      sequencing. RESULTS: Results were analyzed and compared based on milk
      pasteurization and source, spatial variability (core, outer, and under the rind),
      and length of aging (2-4 up to 12-18 months). The dominant organisms in the Gouda
      cheeses, based on percentage of sequence reads identified at the family or genus 
      levels, were Bacillaceae, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and
      Staphylococcus. More genus- or family-level (e.g. Bacillaceae) identifications
      were observed in the Gouda cheeses prepared with unpasteurized cow milk (120)
      compared with those prepared with pasteurized cow milk (92). When assessing
      influence of spatial variability on the metagenomics of the cheese, more
      pronounced differences in bacterial genera were observed in the samples taken
      under the rind; Brachybacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, Yersinia, Klebsiella, and
      Weissella were only detected in these samples. Lastly, the aging length of the
      cheese greatly influenced the number of organisms observed. Twenty-seven
      additional genus-level identifications were observed in Gouda cheese aged for
      12-18 months compared with cheese only aged 2-4 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Collectively, the results of this study are important in determining the typical 
      microbiota associated with Gouda cheese and how the microbiome plays a role in
      safety and quality.

TI  - Monensin Alters the Functional and Metabolomic Profile of Rumen Microbiota in
      Beef Cattle.
LID - E211 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani8110211 [doi]
AB  - To identify differences in rumen function as a result of feeding monensin to beef
      cattle, rumen fluid metagenomics and metabolomics analyses were used to evaluate 
      the functional attributes and metabolites of rumen microbiota in beef steers fed 
      no or 200 mg/d of monensin. Eight rumen-fistulated steers were used in the study 
      for a period of 53 days. Rumen fluid samples were collected on the last day of
      the experiment. Monensin increased the relative abundance of Selenomonas sp.
      ND2010, Prevotella dentalis, Hallella seregens, Parabacteroides distasonis,
      Propionispira raffinosivorans, and Prevotella brevis, but reduced the relative
      abundance of Robinsoniella sp. KNHs210, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus, Clostridium
      botulinum, Clostridium symbiosum, Burkholderia sp. LMG29324, and Clostridium
      butyricum. Monensin increased the relative abundance of functional genes involved
      in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. A total of 245 metabolites were
      identified. Thirty-one metabolites were found to be differentially expressed.
      Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites revealed upregulated
      metabolic pathways associated with metabolism of linoleic acid and some amino
      acids. These findings confirm that monensin affects rumen fermentation of
      forage-fed beef cattle by modulating the rumen microbiome, and by reducing amino 
      acid degradation and biohydrogenation of linoleic acid in the rumen.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most hazardous byproducts of some types of
      mining. However, research on how AMD affects the bacterial community structure of
      downstream riverine ecosystems and the distribution of metal resistance genes
      (MRGs) along pollution gradient is limited. Comprehensive geochemical and
      high-throughput next-generation sequencing analyses can be integrated to
      characterize spatial distributions and MRG profiles of sediment bacteria
      communities along the AMD-contaminated Hengshi River. We found that (1)
      diversities of bacterial communities significantly and gradually increased along 
      the river with decreasing contamination, suggesting community composition
      reflected changes in geochemical conditions; (2) relative abundances of phyla
      Proteobacteria and genus Halomonas and Planococcaceae that function in metal
      reduction decreased along the AMD gradient; (3) low levels of sediment salinity, 
      sulfate, aquatic lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) were negatively correlated with
      bacterial diversity despite pH was in a positive manner with diversity; and (4)
      arsenic (As) and copper (Cu) resistance genes corresponded to sediment
      concentrations of As and Cu, respectively. Altogether, our findings offer initial
      insight into the distribution patterns of sediment bacterial community structure,
      diversity and MRGs along a lotic ecosystem contaminated by AMD, and the factors
      that affect them.

AB  - River is considered generally as a natural reservoir of antibiotic resistance
      genes (ARGs) in environments. For the prevention and control of ARG risks, it is 
      critical to comprehensively characterize the antibiotic resistomes and their
      associations in riverine systems. In this study, we proposed a metagenomic
      framework for identifying antibiotic resistomes in river sediments from multiple 
      categories, including ARG potential, ARG hosts, pathogenicity potential,
      co-selection potential and gene transfer potential, and applied it to understand 
      the presence, hosts, and co-occurrence of ARGs in the sediments of an urban river
      in Beijing. Results showed that a total of 203 ARG subtypes belonging to 21 ARG
      types were detected in the river sediments with an abundance range of
      107.7-1004.1x/Gb, dominated by multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin,
      bacitracin, quinolone and sulfonamide resistance genes. Host-tracking analysis
      identified Dechloromonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Arenimonas, Lysobacter and
      Pseudomonas as the major hosts of ARGs. A number of ARG-carrying contigs (ACCs)
      were annotated as fragments of pathogenic bacteria and carried multiple
      multidrug-ARGs. In addition, various biocide/metal resistance genes (B/MRGs) and 
      mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including prophages, plasmids, integrons and
      transposons, were detected in the river sediments. More importantly, the
      co-occurrence analysis via ACCs showed a strong association of ARGs with B/MRGs
      and MGEs, indicating high potential of co-selection and active horizontal
      transmission for ARGs in the river environment, likely driven by the frequent
      impact of anthropogenic activities in that area.

AB  - Electric fishes are a diverse group of freshwater organisms with the ability to
      generate electric organ discharges (EODs) that are used for communication and
      electrolocation. This group (ca. 200 species) has originated in South America,
      and six species colonized the Central American Isthmus. Here, we assembled the
      complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) for three Central American electric 
      fishes (i.e. Sternopygus dariensis, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis, and Apteronotus
      rostratus), and, based on these data, explored their phylogenetic position among 
      Gymnotiformes. The three mitogenomes show the same gene order, as reported for
      other fishes, with a size ranging from 16,631 to 17,093bp. We uncovered a novel
      60bp intergenic spacer (IGS) located between the COII and tRNA(Lys) genes, which 
      appears to be unique to the Apteronotidae. Furthermore, phylogenetic
      relationships supported the traditional monophyly of Gymnotiformes, with the
      three species positioned within their respective family. In addition, the genus
      Apteronotus belongs to the early diverging lineage of the order. Finally, we
      found high sequence divergence (13%) between our B. occidentalis specimen and a
      sequence previously reported in GenBank, suggesting that the prior mitogenome of 
      B. occidentalis represents a different South American species. Indeed,
      phylogenetic analyses using Cytochrome b gene across the genus placed the
      previously reported individual within B. bennetti. Our study provides novel
      mitogenome resources that will advance our understanding of the diversity and
      phylogenetic history of Neotropical fishes.

AB  - Although second generation biofuel technology is a sustainable route for
      bioethanol production it is not currently a robust technology because of certain 
      hindrances viz., unavailability of potential enzyme resources, low efficiency of 
      enzymes and restricted availability of potent enzymes that work under harsh
      conditions in industrial processes. Therefore, bioprospecting of extremophilic
      microorganisms using metagenomics is a promising alternative to discover novel
      microbes and enzymes with efficient tolerance to unfavourable conditions and thus
      could revolutionize the energy sector. Metagenomics a recent field in "omics"
      technology enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms with the goal
      of better understanding microbial dynamics. Metagenomics in conjunction with
      NextGen Sequencing technology facilitates the sequencing of microbial DNA
      directly from environmental samples and has expanded, and transformed our
      knowledge of the microbial world. However, filtering the meaningful information
      from the millions of genomic sequences offers a serious challenge to
      bioinformaticians. The current review holds the opinion tool 'know- how' to
      unravel the secrets of nature while expediting the bio-industrial world. We also 
      discuss the novel biocatalytic agents discovered through metagenomics and how
      bioengineering plays a pivotal role to enhance their efficiency.

TI  - Genomic analysis of the mesophilic Thermotogae genus Mesotoga reveals
      phylogeographic structure and genomic determinants of its distinct metabolism.
PG  - 456-470

AB  - The genus Mesotoga, the only described mesophilic Thermotogae lineage, is common 
      in mesothermic anaerobic hydrocarbon-rich environments. Besides mesophily,
      Mesotoga displays lineage-specific phenotypes, such as no or little H2 production
      and dependence on sulfur-compound reduction, which may influence its ecological
      role. We used comparative genomics of 18 Mesotoga strains (pairwise 16S rRNA
      identity >99%) and a transcriptome of M. prima to investigate how life at
      moderate temperatures affects phylogeography and to interrogate the genomic
      features of its lineage-specific metabolism. We propose that Mesotoga accomplish 
      H2 oxidation and thiosulfate reduction using a sulfide dehydrogenase and a
      hydrogenase-complex and that a pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase acquired from
      Clostridia is responsible for oxidizing acetate. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
      three distinct Mesotoga lineages (89.6%-99.9% average nucleotide identity [ANI]
      within lineages, 79.3%-87.6% ANI between lineages) having different geographic
      distribution patterns and high levels of intra-lineage recombination but little
      geneflow between lineages. Including data from metagenomes, phylogeographic
      patterns suggest that geographical separation historically has been more
      important for Mesotoga than hyperthermophilic Thermotoga and we hypothesize that 
      distribution of Mesotoga is constrained by their anaerobic lifestyle. Our data
      also suggest that recent anthropogenic activities and environments (e.g.,
      wastewater treatment, oil exploration) have expanded Mesotoga habitats and
      dispersal capabilities.

TI  - Hidden diversity of soil giant viruses.
PG  - 4881
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07335-2 [doi]
AB  - Known giant virus diversity is currently skewed towards viruses isolated from
      aquatic environments and cultivated in the laboratory. Here, we employ
      cultivation-independent metagenomics and mini-metagenomics on soils from the
      Harvard Forest, leading to the discovery of 16 novel giant viruses, chiefly
      recovered by mini-metagenomics. The candidate viruses greatly expand phylogenetic
      diversity of known giant viruses and either represented novel lineages or are
      affiliated with klosneuviruses, Cafeteria roenbergensis virus or tupanviruses.
      One assembled genome with a size of 2.4 Mb represents the largest currently known
      viral genome in the Mimiviridae, and others encode up to 80% orphan genes. In
      addition, we find more than 240 major capsid proteins encoded on unbinned
      metagenome fragments, further indicating that giant viruses are underexplored in 
      soil ecosystems. The fact that most of these novel viruses evaded detection in
      bulk metagenomes suggests that mini-metagenomics could be a valuable approach to 
      unearth viral giants.

      enrichment cultures.
PG  - 2002-2014
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14479 [doi]
AB  - Viruses infecting hyperthermophilic archaea of the phylum Crenarchaeota display
      enormous morphological and genetic diversity, and are classified into 12
      families. Eight of these families include only one or two species, indicating
      sparse sampling of the crenarchaeal virus diversity. In an attempt to expand the 
      crenarchaeal virome, we explored virus diversity in the acidic, hot spring Umi
      Jigoku in Beppu, Japan. Environmental samples were used to establish enrichment
      cultures under conditions favouring virus replication. The host diversity in the 
      enrichment cultures was restricted to members of the order Sulfolobales.
      Metagenomic sequencing of the viral communities yielded seven complete or
      near-complete double-stranded DNA virus genomes. Six of these genomes could be
      attributed to polyhedral and filamentous viruses that were observed by electron
      microscopy in the enrichment cultures. Two icosahedral viruses represented
      species in the family Portogloboviridae. Among the filamentous viruses, two were 
      identified as new species in the families Rudiviridae and Lipothrixviridae,
      whereas two other formed a group seemingly distinct from the known virus genera. 
      No particle morphotype could be unequivocally assigned to the seventh viral
      genome, which apparently represents a new virus type. Our results suggest that
      filamentous viruses are globally distributed and are prevalent virus types in
      extreme geothermal environments.

TI  - First Molecular Identification of Symbiotic Archaea in a Sponge Collected from
      the Persian Gulf, Iran.
PG  - 323-332
LID - 10.2174/1874285801812010323 [doi]
AB  - Background: Marine sponges are associated with numerically vast and
      phylogenetically diverse microbial communities at different geographical
      locations. However, little is known about the archaeal diversity of sponges in
      the Persian Gulf. The present study was aimed to identify the symbiotic archaea
      with a sponge species gathered from the Persian Gulf, Iran. Methods: Sponge
      sample was collected from a depth of 3 m offshore Bushehr, Persian Gulf, Iran.
      Metagenomic DNA was extracted using a hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
      method. The COI mtDNA marker was used for molecular taxonomy identification of
      sponge sample. Also, symbiotic archaea were identified using the
      culture-independent analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and PCR- cloning. Results: In
      this study, analysis of multilocus DNA marker and morphological characteristics
      revealed that the sponge species belonged to Chondrilla australiensis isolate
      PG_BU4. PCR cloning and sequencing showed that all of the sequences of archaeal
      16S rRNA gene libraries clustered into the uncultured archaeal group. Conclusion:
      The present study is the first report of the presence of the genus of Chondrilla 
      in the Persian Gulf. Traditional taxonomy methods, when used along with molecular
      techniques, could play a significant role in the accurate taxonomy of sponges.
      Also, the uncultured archaea may promise a potential source for bioactive
      compounds. Further functional studies are needed to explore the role of the
      sponge-associated uncultured archaea as a part of the marine symbiosis.

AB  - Tuber magnatum Pico, the delectable white truffle, is the most prized truffle
      species. In this study, we examined the reddish pigmentation that frequently
      occurs in T. magnatum ascomata for the presence of pigment-producing bacteria.
      The inner part of the reddish-pigmented region of three T. magnatum ascomata
      collected in North-Central Italy was analysed. This reddish part was used to
      establish a bacterial culture collection and to extract the total genomic DNA in 
      order to obtain a library of 16S rRNA genes representative of the bacterial
      community. The molecular approach revealed limited microbial diversity within the
      reddish-pigmented regions compared to the wider range of bacterial species
      commonly found at the same maturation stage and season in T. magnatum ascomata.
      The pigmented regions showed a prevalence of specific bacterial species belonging
      to alpha-, beta- and gamma- Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. From
      the tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the extracted pigment, four compounds
      were identified: i) bixin, ii) beta-carotene, iii) cis-1-glycosyl-apo-8'-
      lycopene and iv) the fucoxanthin. Carotenoid producing species such as
      Microbacterium and Chryseobacterium emerged as the most likely cause of the
      peculiar reddish pigment production. Indeed, our findings suggest that the
      peculiar reddish pigment might be produced by these bacterial species.

AB  - CrAssphages represent the most abundant virus in the human gut microbiota, but
      the lack of available genome sequences for comparison has kept them enigmatic.
      Recently, sequence-based classification of distantly related crAss-like phages
      from multiple environments was reported, leading to a proposed familial-level
      taxonomic group. Here, we assembled the metagenomic sequencing reads from 702
      human fecal virome/phageome samples and analyzed 99 complete circular crAss-like 
      phage genomes and 150 contigs >/=70 kb. In silico comparative genomics and
      taxonomic analysis enabled a classification scheme of crAss-like phages from
      human fecal microbiomes into four candidate subfamilies composed of ten candidate
      genera. Laboratory analysis was performed on fecal samples from an individual
      harboring seven distinct crAss-like phages. We achieved crAss-like phage
      propagation in ex vivo human fecal fermentations and visualized short-tailed
      podoviruses by electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry of a crAss-like phage
      capsid protein could be linked to metagenomic sequencing data, confirming
      crAss-like phage structural annotations.

AB  - In a recently published article we report the metagenomic analysis of human gut
      microbiomes evolved in the absence of immunoglobulin A (IgA). We show that human 
      IgA deficiency is not associated with massive quantitative perturbations of gut
      microbial ecology. While our study underlines a rather expected pathobiont
      expansion, we at the same time highlight a less expected depletion in some
      typically beneficial symbionts. We also show that IgM partially supply IgA
      deficiency, explaining the relatively mild clinical phenotype associated with the
      early steps of this condition. Microbiome studies in patients should consider
      potential issues such as cohort size, human genetic polymorphism and treatments. 
      In this commentary, we discuss how such issues were taken into account in our own
      study.

AB  - Biofouling of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane is a significant issue for the water 
      treatment industry. In this study, we apply the metagenomic shot-gun sequencing
      technology to characterise the composition and functional potential of the
      microbial community in a full-scale RO plant, at different stages of seawater
      treatment. We find Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes to be the
      most abundant bacterial phyla. The genetic potential of the RO membrane microbial
      community shows the enrichment of genes involved in biofilm formation,
      representing the selective pressure of the biofilm formation process. We recover 
      31 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from intake (raw seawater), fouled RO
      membranes (leading and middle RO module) and brine reject water. A total of 25
      MAGs are recovered from the biofilm samples (leading and middle RO modules), with
      9 of them (36%) belonging to Planctomycetes. We investigate all 25 MAGs for genes
      (pili, flagella, quorum sensing, quorum quenching and nitrate reduction) that
      play an important role in biofilm formation and sustenance of cells. We show that
      Planctomycetes contain genes for the formation of flagella and pili, and the
      reduction of nitrate. Although genes for quorum sensing are not detected, quorum 
      quenching genes are identified in the biofilm MAGs. Our results show that
      Planctomycetes, along with other microbes, play an important role in the
      formation and sustenance of biofilms on seawater RO membranes.

      information on microbial diversity. The objective was to explore the milk
      microbiome at the time of the mastitis event (enrollment) and its association
      with survival in the herd, milk production, and postevent linear score (LS) for
      cows with clinical mastitis characterized as negative or E. coli by culture.
      Fifty E. coli-positive and 35 culture-negative samples from cases were enrolled. 
      No cases were treated with antimicrobials. All E. coli-positive quarters were
      characterized as transient; microbiological culture of samples taken 15 d
      postmastitis were negative for this organism. However, a difference in
      alpha-diversity (Shannon index) was present between enrollment and follow-up
      samples (3.8 vs. 5.1). When alpha-diversity was explored for enrollment E. coli
      samples, no relationship was observed between the Shannon indices of these
      samples and postmastitis LS. Alpha-diversity of the enrollment samples was lower 
      for E. coli-positive cows that subsequently had greater losses in milk
      production. This difference was explained by a greater relative abundance of the 
      family Enterobacteriaceae (67.8 vs. 38.4%) for cows that dropped in production.
      Analysis of composition of the microbiome identified one phylum, Proteobacteria, 
      that differed between E. coli-positive cows that dropped in production and those 
      that did not. Evaluation of beta -diversity found no statistical relationship
      between postmastitis LS and the microbiome. When evaluating alpha- and
      beta-diversities and composition of the microbiomes for culture-negative
      quarters, no associations were found for milk production changes and postmastitis
      LS. Three cows did not remain in the herd, limiting the ability to analyze
      survival. The findings suggest that a contributing factor to negative outcomes in
      E. coli-positive cows is relative abundance of this pathogen, and that no single 
      or collective group of bacterial families is associated with milk production
      changes or postmastitis LS in culture-negative quarters. Although additional
      studies should be performed, the absence of associations between outcomes
      explored and microbial profiles in this study suggests that we are not missing
      opportunities by not treating nonsevere E. coli or culture-negative mastitis
      cases.

AB  - Bivalve molluscs of the genus Mytilus are considered a model organism in
      ecotoxicology and are known to be well adapted to marine ecosystems affected by
      multiple anthropogenic factors, including pollution. In order to assess whether
      pollution interferes with the reproductive success of Mytilus and affects the
      diversity within and between populations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 72
      individuals from 9 populations of Mytilus galloprovincialis collected along a ca.
      130-km north-south transect on the Western coast of the Iberian Peninsula. We
      found that polluted areas are acting as a barrier to gene flow, potentially
      because of the detrimental effect of anthropogenic chemicals on larvae carried
      from more pristine environments. Furthermore, we observed an increase in genetic 
      diversity in populations from polluted site, which could be indicative of higher 
      mutagenicity driven by the environment. We propose that a microevolutionary
      perspective is essential for a full characterization of human activities on the
      dispersal of M. galloprovincialis and that it should be incorporated into
      management, and conservation plans and policies in the context of the effects of 
      pollution on populations.

AB  - In recent years, a large number of time series microbial community data has been 
      produced in molecular biological studies, especially in metagenomics. Among the
      statistical methods for time series, local similarity analysis is used in a wide 
      range of environments to capture potential local and time-shifted associations
      that cannot be distinguished by traditional correlation analysis. Initially, the 
      permutation test is popularly applied to obtain the statistical significance of
      local similarity analysis. More recently, a theoretical method has also been
      developed to achieve this aim. However, all these methods require the assumption 
      that the time series are independent and identically distributed. In this paper, 
      we propose a new approach based on moving block bootstrap to approximate the
      statistical significance of local similarity scores for dependent time series.
      Simulations show that our method can control the type I error rate reasonably,
      while theoretical approximation and the permutation test perform less well.
      Finally, our method is applied to human and marine microbial community datasets, 
      indicating that it can identify potential relationship among operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) and significantly decrease the rate of false positives.

TI  - Periodic and Spatial Spreading of Alkanes and Alcanivorax Bacteria in Deep Waters
      of the Mariana Trench.
LID - e02089-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02089-18 [doi]
AB  - In subduction zones, serpentinization and biological processes may release
      alkanes to the deep waters, which would probably result in the rapid spread of
      Alcanivorax However, the timing and area of the alkane distribution and
      associated enrichment of alkane-degrading microbes in the dark world of the deep 
      ocean have not been explored. In this study, we report the richness (up to 17.8%)
      of alkane-degrading bacteria, represented by Alcanivorax jadensis, in deep water 
      samples obtained at 3,000 to 6,000 m in the Mariana Trench in two cruises. The
      relative abundance of A. jadensis correlated with copy numbers of functional almA
      and alkB genes, which are involved in alkane degradation. In these water samples,
      we detected a high flux of alkanes, which probably resulted in the prevalence of 
      A. jadensis in the deep waters. Contigs of A. jadensis were binned from the
      metagenomes for examination of alkane degradation pathways and deep sea-specific 
      pathways, which revealed a lack of nitrate and nitrite dissimilatory reduction in
      our A. jadensis strains. Comparing the results for the two cruises conducted
      close to each other, we suggest periodic release of alkanes that may spread
      widely but periodically in the trench. Distribution of alkane-degrading bacteria 
      in the world's oceans suggests the periodic and remarkable contributions of
      Alcanivorax to the deep sea organic carbon and nitrogen sources.IMPORTANCE In the
      oligotrophic environment of the Mariana Trench, alkanes as carbohydrates are
      important for the ecosystem, but their spatial and periodic spreading in deep
      waters has never been reported. Alkane-degrading bacteria such as Alcanivorax
      spp. are biological signals of the alkane distribution. In the present study,
      Alcanivorax was abundant in some waters, at depths of up to 6,000 m, in the
      Mariana Trench. Genomic, transcriptomic, and chemical analyses provide evidence
      for the presence and activities of Alcanivorax jadensis in deep sea zones. The
      periodic spreading of alkanes, probably from the subductive plates, might have
      fundamentally modified the local microbial communities, as well as perhaps the
      deep sea microenvironment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carotid body (peripheral oxygen sensor) sensitisation is pivotal in
      the development of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)-induced hypertension. We
      sought to determine if exposure to CIH, modelling human sleep apnoea, adversely
      affects cardiorespiratory control in guinea-pigs, a species with
      hypoxia-insensitive carotid bodies. We reasoned that CIH-induced disruption of
      gut microbiota would evoke cardiorespiratory morbidity. METHODS: Adult male
      guinea-pigs were exposed to CIH (6.5% O2 at nadir, 6cycles.hour(-1)) for
      8h.day(-1) for 12 consecutive days. FINDINGS: CIH-exposed animals established
      reduced faecal microbiota species richness, with increased relative abundance of 
      Bacteroidetes and reduced relative abundance of Firmicutes bacteria. Urinary
      corticosterone and noradrenaline levels were unchanged in CIH-exposed animals,
      but brainstem noradrenaline concentrations were lower compared with sham.
      Baseline ventilation was equivalent in CIH-exposed and sham animals; however,
      respiratory timing variability, sigh frequency and ventilation during hypoxic
      breathing were all lower in CIH-exposed animals. Baseline arterial blood pressure
      was unaffected by exposure to CIH, but beta-adrenoceptor-dependent tachycardia
      and blunted bradycardia during phenylephrine-induced pressor responses was
      evident compared with sham controls. INTERPRETATION: Increased carotid body
      chemo-afferent signalling appears obligatory for the development of CIH-induced
      hypertension and elevated chemoreflex control of breathing commonly reported in
      mammals, with hypoxia-sensitive carotid bodies. However, we reveal that exposure 
      to modest CIH alters gut microbiota richness and composition, brainstem
      neurochemistry, and autonomic control of heart rate, independent of carotid body 
      sensitisation, suggesting modulation of breathing and autonomic homeostasis via
      the microbiota-gut-brainstem axis. The findings have relevance to human
      sleep-disordered breathing. FUNDING: The Department of Physiology, and APC

AB  - Bacterial communities in the Arctic environment are subject to multiple stress
      factors, including contaminants, although typically their concentrations are
      small. The Arctic contamination research has focused on persistent organic
      pollutants (POPs) because they are bioaccumulative, resistant to degradation and 
      toxic for all organisms. Pollutants have entered the Arctic predominantly by
      atmospheric and oceanic long-range transport, and this was facilitated by their
      volatile or semi-volatile properties, while their chemical stability extended
      their lifetimes following emission. Chemicals present in the Arctic at detectable
      and quantifiable concentrations testify to their global impact. Chemical
      contamination may induce serious disorders in the integrity of polar ecosystems
      influencing the growth of bacterial communities. In this study, the abundance and
      the types of bacteria in the Arctic freshwater were examined and the microbial
      characteristics were compared to the amount of potentially harmful chemical
      compounds in particular elements of the Arctic catchment. The highest
      concentrations of all determined PAHs were observed in two samples in the
      vicinity of the estuary both in June and September 2016 and were 1964ngL(-1)
      (R12) and 3901ngL(-1) (R13) in June, and 2179ngL(-1) (R12) and 1349ngL(-1) (R13) 
      in September. Remarkable concentrations of the sum of phenols and formaldehyde
      were detected also at the outflow of the Revelva river into the sea (R12) and
      were 0.24mgL(-1) in June and 0.35mgL(-1) in September 2016. The elevated
      concentrations of chemical compounds near the estuary suggest a potential impact 
      of the water from the lower tributaries (including the glacier-fed stream
      measured at R13) or the sea currents and the sea aerosol as pollutant sources.
      The POPs' degradation at low temperature is not well understood but bacteria
      capable to degrading such compounds were noted in each sampling point.

AB  - False-positive identifications are a significant problem in metagenomics
      classification. We present KrakenUniq, a novel metagenomics classifier that
      combines the fast k-mer-based classification of Kraken with an efficient
      algorithm for assessing the coverage of unique k-mers found in each species in a 
      dataset. On various test datasets, KrakenUniq gives better recall and precision
      than other methods and effectively classifies and distinguishes pathogens with
      low abundance from false positives in infectious disease samples. By using the
      probabilistic cardinality estimator HyperLogLog, KrakenUniq runs as fast as
      Kraken and requires little additional memory. KrakenUniq is freely available at
      https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq .

TI  - The Effect of Influenza Virus on the Human Oropharyngeal Microbiome.
PG  - 1993-2002
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciy821 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary bacterial infections are an important cause of morbidity
      and mortality associated with influenza infections. As bacterial disease can be
      caused by a disturbance of the host microbiome, we examined the impact of
      influenza on the upper respiratory tract microbiome in a human challenge study.
      METHODS: The dynamics and ecology of the throat microbiome were examined
      following an experimental influenza challenge of 52 previously-healthy adult
      volunteers with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) by intranasal inoculation;
      35 healthy control subjects were not subjected to the viral challenge. Serial
      oropharyngeal samples were taken over a 30-day period, and the V1-V3 region of
      the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences were amplified and sequenced to
      determine the composition of the microbiome. The carriage of pathogens was also
      detected. RESULTS: Of the 52 challenged individuals, 43 developed proven
      influenza infections, 33 of whom became symptomatic. None of the controls
      developed influenza, although 22% reported symptoms. The diversity of bacterial
      communities remained remarkably stable following the acquisition of influenza,
      with no significant differences over time between individuals with influenza and 
      those in the control group. Influenza infection was not associated with
      perturbation of the microbiome at the level of phylum or genus. There was no
      change in colonization rates with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria
      meningitidis. CONCLUSIONS: The throat microbiota is resilient to influenza
      infection, indicating the robustness of the upper-airway microbiome.

AB  - Ultramafic (i.e. serpentine) soils are widespread in the Balkans and particularly
      in Albania. They account for a large part of plant endemism in that region and
      host several hyperaccumulator species, which are characterized by leaf nickel
      concentrations frequently above 1%. This rich nickel hyperaccumulating flora
      could serve as candidate to be used in phytoextraction and agromining. Despite
      recent interest in metal hyperaccumulating plants and agromining, very few
      studies have investigated the bacterial diversity and the influence of
      environmental factors on microbial gene profiles in the rhizosphere of
      hyperaccumulator plants growing on ultramafic soils. Because rhizospheric
      bacteria could be crucial to the success of phytoremediation, we studied a total 
      of 48 nickel-hyperaccumulating plants which were sampled from four species that
      are widespread in Albania: Noccaea ochroleuca, Odontarrhena smolikana, O. rigida 
      and O. chalcidica. All samples were taken from the ultramafic regions of Librazhd
      and Pogradec in eastern Albania in October 2015. Our study shows that
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria dominated the soil bacterial
      communities. Of these three phyla, only Proteobacteria was relatively abundant.
      This study underlines the influence of soil Cation Exchange Capacity on the
      bacterial community's diversity and structure. Based on the predicted
      metagenomes, the genes belonging to amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate
      metabolisms were identified as major gene families. Our study sheds some light on
      our understanding of how bacterial communities are structured within and affect
      the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulator plants from ultramafic soils in Albania.

AB  - Metaproteomics was established to analyse both the structure and the function of 
      microbial communities and, particularly in soils, their contribution to ecosystem
      services. In this review, we provide an overview on how the study of the soil
      metaproteome can provide fundamental information on the role of microbial
      communities in soil ecosystem services. We further discuss the strengths and
      weaknesses of soil metaproteomics in comparison to other culture-independent OMIC
      techniques. We critically review its bottlenecks but also provide strategies to
      mitigate and possible directions for future research as the direct link of
      structure and function is advantageous and complementary to metagenomics,
      metatranscriptomics and metametabolomics.

AB  - Five years after being discovered in 2003, some giant viruses were demonstrated
      to play a role of the hosts for virophages, their parasites, setting out a novel 
      and yet unknown regulatory mechanism of the giant viruses presence in an aqueous.
      So far, 20 virophages have been registered and 13 of them have been described as 
      a metagenomic material, which indirectly impacts the number of single- and
      multi-cell organisms, the environment where giant viruses replicate.

AB  - Aquatic viruses include infected viruses in aquatic animals, plants and
      microorganisms, and free-floating viruses (virioplankton) in water environments. 
      In the last three decades, a huge number of aquatic viruses, especially diverse
      free-floating viruses, including cyanophages, phycoviruses, archaea viruses,
      giant viruses, and even virophages, have been identified by virological
      experiments and metagenomic analyses. Based on a comprehensive introduction of
      aquatic virus classification and their morphological and genetic diversity, here,
      we summarize and outline main virus species, their evolutionary contribution to
      aquatic communities through horizontal gene transfer, and their ecological roles 
      for cyanobacterial bloom termination and global biogeochemical cycling in
      freshwater and marine ecosystems. Thereby, some novel insights of aquatic viruses
      and virus-host interactions, especially their evolutionary contribution and
      ecological rolesin diverse aquatic communities and ecosystems, are highlighted in
      this review.

TI  - Evaluating the Information Content of Shallow Shotgun Metagenomics.
LID - e00069-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00069-18 [doi]
AB  - Although microbial communities are associated with human, environmental, plant,
      and animal health, there exists no cost-effective method for precisely
      characterizing species and genes in such communities. While deep whole-metagenome
      shotgun (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional resolution, it is
      often prohibitively expensive for large-scale studies. The prevailing
      alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing, often does not resolve
      taxonomy past the genus level and provides only moderately accurate predictions
      of the functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted approach
      to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and functional microbiome analysis. To
      address this technology gap, we evaluated the information content of shallow
      shotgun sequencing with as low as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an
      alternative to 16S sequencing for large human microbiome studies. We describe a
      library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing at approximately
      the same per-sample cost as 16S sequencing. We analyzed multiple real and
      simulated biological data sets, including two novel human stool samples with
      ultradeep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow 
      shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate species-level taxonomic and functional 
      profiles of the human microbiome than 16S sequencing. We discuss the inherent
      limitations of shallow shotgun sequencing and note that 16S sequencing remains a 
      valuable and important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments.
      Although deep WMS sequencing remains the gold standard for high-resolution
      microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers consider shallow shotgun
      sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S sequencing for large-scale human
      microbiome research studies where WMS sequencing may be cost-prohibitive.
      IMPORTANCE A common refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is
      that the field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S
      sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using shotgun
      sequencing. However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in large longitudinal
      studies remains prohibitively expensive for all but the most well-funded research
      labs and consortia, which leads many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for
      large studies, followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted
      samples. Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun sequencing may be 
      used by researchers to obtain species-level taxonomic and functional data at
      approximately the same cost as amplicon sequencing. While shallow shotgun
      sequencing is not intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level
      characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider using shallow 
      shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for large-scale human microbiome
      studies.

      environments.
PG  - 805-823
LID - 10.1038/s41396-018-0312-9 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian hosts constantly interact with diverse exogenous microbes, but only a
      subset of the microbes manage to colonize due to selective colonization
      resistance exerted by host genetic factors as well as the native microbiota of
      the host. An important question in microbial ecology and medical science is if
      such colonization resistance can discriminate closely related microbial species, 
      or even closely related strains of the same species. Using human-mouse fecal
      microbiota transplantation and metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we reconstructed
      colonization patterns of human fecal microbes in mice with different genotypes
      (C57BL6/J vs. NSG) and with or without an intact gut microbiota. We found that
      mouse genotypes and the native mouse gut microbiota both exerted different
      selective pressures on exogenous colonizers: human fecal Bacteroides successfully
      established in the mice gut, however, different species of Bacteroides
      selectively enriched under different gut conditions, potentially due to a
      multitude of functional differences, ranging from versatility in nutrient
      acquisition to stress responses. Additionally, different clades of Bacteroides
      cellulosilyticus strains were selectively enriched in different gut conditions,
      suggesting that the fitness of conspecific microbial strains in a novel host
      environment could differ.

TI  - Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals Individual Composition and
      Dynamics of Anelloviruses during Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Recipient
      Management.
LID - E633 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v10110633 [doi]
AB  - Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of the
      anelloviruses, the major component of the human virome, for the prediction of
      post-transplant complications such as severe infections. Due to an important
      diversity, the comprehensive characterization of this viral family over time has 
      been poorly studied. To overcome this challenge, we used a metagenomic
      next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach with the aim of determining the
      individual anellovirus profile of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
      patients. We conducted a prospective pilot study on a homogeneous patient cohort 
      regarding the chemotherapy regimens that included 10 ASCT recipients. A validated
      viral mNGS workflow was used on 108 plasma samples collected at 11 time points
      from diagnosis to 90 days post-transplantation. A complex interindividual
      variability in terms of abundance and composition was noticed. In particular, a
      strong sex effect was found and confirmed using quantitative PCR targeting torque
      teno virus, the most abundant anellovirus. Interestingly, an important turnover
      in the anellovirus composition was observed during the course of the disease
      revealing a strong intra-individual variability. Although more studies are needed
      to better understand anellovirus dynamics, these findings are of prime importance
      for their future use as biomarkers of immune competence.

AB  - Gut microbiome plays an important role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a
      group of intestinal chronic inflammation conditions that affect a large
      population. The animal models of IBD have long been established on basis of
      pathological features, but their ability to recapitulate patient gut microbiota
      is unknown. We investigated and compared the composition and biodiversity of
      bacterial population in the fecal samples from rat models of the two IBD
      subtypes, and compared them with patient samples. Our analyses revealed that
      inflammation reduces overall microbiome diversity and increased variation between
      individuals. We identified specific microbial signatures associated with the two 
      IBD subtypes that were consistent between the animal models and human IBD
      patients, suggesting that the animal models can partially recapitulate the
      microbiota in human diseases. Furthermore, metagenome prediction analysis
      suggested microbial functions that were likely altered by host-microbiota
      interactions in IBD models.

      Barnes-Hut t-Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512529 [doi]
AB  - Shotgun metagenomic studies attempt to reconstruct population genome sequences
      from complex microbial communities. In some traditional genome demarcation
      approaches, high-dimensional sequence data are embedded into two-dimensional
      spaces and subsequently binned into candidate genomic populations. One such
      approach uses a combination of the Barnes-Hut approximation and the $t
      -$Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-SNE) algorithm for dimensionality reduction
      of DNA sequence data pentamer profiles; and demarcation of groups based on
      Gaussian mixture models within humanimposed boundaries. We found that genome
      demarcation from three-dimensional BH-SNE embeddings consistently results in more
      accurate binnings than 2-D embeddings. We further addressed the lack of a priori 
      population number information by developing an unsupervised binning approach
      based on the Subtractive and Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms combined
      with internal clustering validity indices. Lastly, we addressed the subject of
      shared membership of individual data objects in a mixed community by assigning a 
      degree of membership to individual objects using the FCM algorithm, and
      discriminated between confidently binned and uncertain sequence data objects from
      the community for subsequent biological interpretation. The binning of metagenome
      sequence fragments according to thresholds in the degree of membership opens the 
      door for the identification of horizontally transferred elements and other
      genomic regions of uncertain assignment in which biologically meaningful
      information resides. The reported approach improves the unsupervised genome
      demarcation of populations within complex communities, increases the confidence
      in the coherence of the binned elements, and enables the identification of
      evolutionary processes ignored in hard-binning approaches in shotgun metagenomic 
      studies.

TI  - Evaluation of gastric microbiome and metagenomic function in patients with
      intestinal metaplasia using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
PG  - e12547
LID - 10.1111/hel.12547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in studies on the gastric microbiome, the
      role of the non-Helicobacter pylori gastric microbiome in gastric carcinogenesis 
      remains unclear. We evaluated the characteristics of the gastric microbiome and
      metagenomic functions in patients with IM. METHODS: Participants were classified 
      into six groups according to disease status (chronic superficial gastritis [CSG],
      intestinal metaplasia [IM], and cancer) and H. pylori- infection status (H.
      pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative). The gastric microbiome was analyzed in
      mucosal tissues at the gastric antrum by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Moreover, we
      assessed the metagenome including the type IV secretion system (T4SS) gene, as
      T4SS proteins are essential for transferring CagA from H. pylori- into the human 
      gastric epithelium. RESULTS: Among the 138 included patients, 48, 9, 23, 14, 12, 
      and 32 were classified into the H. pylori-negative CSG, H. pylori-negative IM, H.
      pylori-negative cancer, H. pylori-positive CSG, H. pylori-positive IM, and H.
      pylori-positive cancer groups, respectively. Cyanobacteria were predominant in
      the H. pylori-negative CSG group compared to in the H. pylori-negative IM and H. 
      pylori-negative cancer groups (H. pylori-negative CSG vs H. pylori-negative IM vs
      H. pylori-negative cancer: 14.0% vs 4.2% vs 0.04%, P < 0.001). In contrast,
      Rhizobiales were commonly observed in the H. pylori-negative IM group (H.
      pylori-negative CSG vs H. pylori-negative IM vs H. pylori-negative cancer: 1.9%
      vs 15.4% vs 2.8%, P < 0.001). The relative abundance of Rhizobiales increased as 
      H. pylori-infected stomachs progressed from gastritis to IM. In the H.
      pylori-negative IM group, genes encoding T4SS were prevalent among the
      metagenome. Additionally, after H. pylori- eradication therapy, the gastric
      microbiome was similar to the microbiome observed after spontaneous clearance of 
      H. pylori-. CONCLUSIONS: The relative abundance of Rhizobiales was higher in
      patients with H. pylori-negative IM than in those with H. pylori-negative CSG or 
      cancer. Additionally, T4SS genes were highly observed in the metagenome of
      patients with IM. Highly abundant T4SS proteins in these patients may promote
      gastric carcinogenesis.

AB  - To investigate the differences in activated sludge microbial communities of
      different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and understand their metabolic
      potentials, we sampled sludge from every biological treatment unit of 5
      full-scale waste water treatment systems in 3 typical Chinese municipal WWTPs.
      The microbial communities and overall metabolic patterns were not only affected
      by influent characteristics but also varied between different biological
      treatment units. Distinct genera in different wastewater treatment systems were
      identified. The important microorganisms in domestic sewage treatment systems
      were unclassified SHA-20, Caldilinea, Dechloromonas, and unclassified genera from
      Rhodospirilaceae and Caldilineaceae. The important microorganisms in dyeing
      wastewater treatment systems were Nitrospira, Sphingobacteriales, Thiobacillus,
      Sinobacteraceae and Comamonadaceae. Compared with the obvious differences in
      microbial community composition, the metabolic potential showed no significant
      differences.

TI  - Evaluation of the CosmosID Bioinformatics Platform for Prosthetic
      Joint-Associated Sonicate Fluid Shotgun Metagenomic Data Analysis.
LID - e01182-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01182-18 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated that shotgun metagenomic sequencing can detect
      bacteria in sonicate fluid, providing a diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection
      (PJI). A limitation of the approach that we used is that data analysis was
      time-consuming and specialized bioinformatics expertise was required, both of
      which are barriers to routine clinical use. Fortunately, automated commercial
      analytic platforms that can interpret shotgun metagenomic data are emerging. In
      this study, we evaluated the CosmosID bioinformatics platform using shotgun
      metagenomic sequencing data derived from 408 sonicate fluid samples from our
      prior study with the goal of evaluating the platform vis-a-vis bacterial
      detection and antibiotic resistance gene detection for predicting staphylococcal 
      antibacterial susceptibility. Samples were divided into a derivation set and a
      validation set, each consisting of 204 samples; results from the derivation set
      were used to establish cutoffs, which were then tested in the validation set for 
      identifying pathogens and predicting staphylococcal antibacterial resistance.
      Metagenomic analysis detected bacteria in 94.8% (109/115) of sonicate fluid
      culture-positive PJIs and 37.8% (37/98) of sonicate fluid culture-negative PJIs. 
      Metagenomic analysis showed sensitivities ranging from 65.7 to 85.0% for
      predicting staphylococcal antibacterial resistance. In conclusion, the CosmosID
      platform has the potential to provide fast, reliable bacterial detection and
      identification from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data derived from sonicate
      fluid for the diagnosis of PJI. Strategies for metagenomic detection of
      antibiotic resistance genes for predicting staphylococcal antibacterial
      resistance need further development.

      cellulolytic gammaproteobacterial symbionts harbored in bacteriocytes within the 
      gills. In the present work we applied metagenomics to characterize microbiomes of
      the gills and digestive tract of Neoteredo reynei, a mangrove-adapted shipworm
      species found over a large range of the Brazilian coast. Comparative metagenomics
      grouped the gill symbiont community of different N. reynei specimens, indicating 
      closely related bacterial types are shared. Similarly, the intestine and
      digestive gland communities were related, yet were more diverse than and showed
      no overlap with the gill community. Annotation of assembled metagenomic contigs
      revealed that the gill symbiotic community of N. reynei encodes a plethora of
      plant cell wall polysaccharides degrading glycoside hydrolase encoding genes, and
      Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). In contrast, the digestive tract microbiomes
      seem to play little role in wood digestion and secondary metabolites
      biosynthesis. Metagenome binning recovered the nearly complete genome sequences
      of two symbiotic Teredinibacter strains from the gills, a representative of
      Teredinibacter turnerae "clade I" strain, and a yet to be cultivated
      Teredinibacter sp. type. These Teredinibacter genomes, as well as un-binned
      gill-derived gammaproteobacteria contigs, also include an
      endo-beta-1,4-xylanase/acetylxylan esterase multi-catalytic carbohydrate-active
      enzyme, and a trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase (trans-AT PKS) gene
      cluster with the gene cassette for generating beta-branching on complex
      polyketides. Finally, we use multivariate analyses to show that the secondary
      metabolome from the genomes of Teredinibacter representatives, including genomes 
      binned from N. reynei gills' metagenomes presented herein, stands out within the 
      Cellvibrionaceae family by size, and enrichments for polyketide, nonribosomal
      peptide and hybrid BGCs. Results presented here add to the growing
      characterization of shipworm symbiotic microbiomes and indicate that the N.
      reynei gill gammaproteobacterial community is a prolific source of
      biotechnologically relevant enzymes for wood-digestion and bioactive compounds
      production.

TI  - Body Mass Index as a Determinant of Systemic Exposure to Gallotannin Metabolites 
      during 6-Week Consumption of Mango (Mangifera indica L.) and Modulation of
      Intestinal Microbiota in Lean and Obese Individuals.
PG  - e1800512
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201800512 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: This human clinical pilot trial investigated pharmacokinetics of
      gallotannin-metabolites and modulation of intestinal microbiota in healthy lean
      and obese individuals after 6 weeks of daily mango consumption. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Participants are divided into three groups: Lean Mango (LM: n = 12; BMI 
      = 22.9 kg m(-2) ), Obese Mango (OM: n = 9; BMI = 34.6 kg m(-2) ), and Lean
      Control (LC: n = 11; BMI = 22.1 kg m(-2) ). LM and OM consumed 400 g of mango per
      day for 6 weeks. LC consumed mango only on Days 0 and 42. After 6 weeks, LM
      experienced increased systemic exposure (AUC0-8h ) to gallotannin-metabolites,
      1.4-fold (p = 0.043). The greatest increase is 4-O-methyl-gallic acid, 3.3-fold
      (p = 0.0026). Cumulative urinary excretion of gallotannin-metabolites
      significantly increased in LM and OM, but not LC. For OM, qPCR data show
      increased levels of tannase-producing Lactococcus lactis and decreased levels of 
      Clostridium leptum and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteria associated with
      obesity. LM experienced an increased trend of fecal levels of butyric (1.3-fold; 
      p = 0.09) and valeric acids (1.5-fold; p = 0.056). Plasma endotoxins showed a
      decreased trend in LM and OM. CONCLUSION: Continuous mango intake significantly
      increased systemic exposure to gallotannin- metabolites and induced an increased 
      trend for fecal short-chain fatty acids in lean but not obese individuals. This
      pharmacokinetic discrepancy may result in BMI-associated reduced
      gallotannin-derived health benefits.

PG  - e5906

AB  - Symbiotic relationships between host and microbiome can play a major role in
      local adaptation. Previous studies with freshwater organisms have shown that
      microbiome performs numerous important biochemical functions for the host,
      playing a key role in metabolism, physiology or health. Experimental studies in
      fish groups have found an effect of enzymatic activity of gut microbiota on a
      variety of metabolic processes. The goal of this study was to compare stomach
      microbiome from cave and surface Astyanax mexicanus, in order to evaluate the
      potential response of microbiota to contrasting environmental conditions and
      physiological adaptations of the host. Stomach microbiota was obtained from three
      different populations: Pachon cave, and two surface rivers (Rascon and Micos
      rivers). The stomach microbiome was analyzed using the Ion 16S Metagenomic kit
      considering seven variable regions: V2, V3, V4, V6-7, V8 and V9. A high diversity
      was observed across samples, including 16 phyla, 120 families and 178 genera.
      Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria were the
      most abundant phyla across the samples. Although the relative abundance of the
      core OTUs at genus level were highly contrasting among populations, we did not
      recover differences in stomach microbiome between contrasting habitats (cave vs. 
      surface rivers). Rather, we observed a consistent association between
      beta-diversity and dissolved oxygen concentration in water. Therefore, and
      unexpectedly, the microbiota of A. mexicanus is not linked with the contrasting
      conditions of the habitat considered here but is related to water parameters.

TI  - Reduction of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria During Conventional and Advanced
      Wastewater Treatment, and the Disseminated Loads Released to the Environment.
PG  - 2599
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02599 [doi]
AB  - The occurrence of new chemical and microbiological contaminants in the aquatic
      environment has become an issue of increasing environmental concern. Thus,
      wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important part in the distribution of
      so-called new emerging pathogens and antibiotic resistances. Therefore, the daily
      loads released by the WWTP were calculated including a model system for the
      distribution of these loads within the receiving water body. UV-, as well as
      ozone-treatment in separate or in combination for wastewater treatment were under
      investigation aiming at the reduction of these loads. Here, the impact of these
      treatments on the DNA integrity via antibody staining and PCR efficiencies
      experiments were included. All three facultative pathogenic bacteria [enterococci
      (23S rRNA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ecfX), and Escherichia coli (yccT)] and seven
      clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (mecA (methicillin
      resistance gene), ctx-M32 (beta- lactame resistance gene), ermB (erythromycine
      resistance gene), bla TEM (beta- lactame resistance gene), sul1 (sulfonamide
      resistance gene), vanA (vancomycin resistance gene), and intI1 (Integrase1 gene) 
      associated with mobile genetic elements were detected in wastewaters. Different
      reduction efficiencies were analyzed during advanced wastewater treatments. ARGs 
      were still found to be present in the effluents under the parameters of 1.0 g
      ozone per g dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 400 J/m(2), like ctx-M32, ermB,
      bla TEM, sul1, and intI1. Especially UV radiation induced thymidine dimerization 
      which was analyzed via antibody mediated detection in the metagenome of the
      natural wastewater population. These specific DNA alterations were not observed
      during ozone treatment and combinations of UV/ozone treatment. The dimerization
      or potential other DNA alterations during UV treatment might be responsible for a
      decreased PCR efficiency of the 16S rRNA amplicons (176, 490, and 880 bp
      fragments) from natural metagenomes compared to the untreated sample. This impact
      on PCR efficiencies was also observed for the combination of ozone and UV
      treatment.

AB  - Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, including elevated abundance of putative leading
      bacterial triggers such as E. coli in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, 
      is of great interest. To date, most E. coli studies in IBD patients are focused
      on clinical isolates, overlooking their relative abundances and turnover over
      time. Metagenomics-based studies, on the other hand, are less focused on
      strain-level investigations. Here, using recently developed bioinformatic tools, 
      we analyzed the abundance and properties of specific E. coli strains in a Crohns 
      disease (CD) patient longitudinally, while also considering the composition of
      the entire community over time. In this report, we conducted a pilot study on
      metagenomic-based, strain-level analysis of a time-series of E. coli strains in a
      left-sided CD patient, who exhibited sustained levels of E. coli greater than
      100X healthy controls. We: (1) mapped out the composition of the gut microbiome
      over time, particularly the presence of E. coli strains, and found that the
      abundance and dominance of specific E. coli strains in the community varied over 
      time; (2) performed strain-level de novo assemblies of seven dominant E. coli
      strains, and illustrated disparity between these strains in both phylogenetic
      origin and genomic content; (3) observed that strain ST1 (recovered during peak
      inflammation) is highly similar to known pathogenic AIEC strains NC101 and LF82
      in both virulence factors and metabolic functions, while other strains (ST2-ST7) 
      that were collected during more stable states displayed diverse characteristics; 
      (4) isolated, sequenced, experimentally characterized ST1, and confirmed the
      accuracy of the de novo assembly; and (5) assessed growth capability of ST1 with 
      a newly reconstructed genome-scale metabolic model of the strain, and showed its 
      potential to use substrates found abundantly in the human gut to outcompete other
      microbes. In conclusion, inflammation status (assessed by the blood C-reactive
      protein and stool calprotectin) is likely correlated with the abundance of a
      subgroup of E. coli strains with specific traits. Therefore, strain-level
      time-series analysis of dominant E. coli strains in a CD patient is highly
      informative, and motivates a study of a larger cohort of IBD patients.

AB  - Autochthonous bioaugmentation, by exploiting the indigenous microorganisms of the
      contaminated environment to be treated, can represent a successful bioremediation
      strategy. In this perspective, we have assessed by molecular methods the
      evolution of bacterial and fungal communities during the selective enrichment on 
      different pollutants of a soil strongly polluted by mixtures of aliphatic and
      polycyclic hydrocarbons. Three consecutive enrichments were carried out on soil
      samples from different soil depths (0-1, 1-2, 2-3 m), and analyzed at each step
      by means of high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal amplicons
      biomarkers. At the end of the enrichments, bacterial and fungal contaminants
      degrading strains were isolated and identified in order to (i) compare the
      composition of enriched communities by culture-dependent and culture-independent 
      molecular methods and to (ii) obtain a collection of hydrocarbon degrading
      microorganisms potentially exploitable for soil bioremediation. Molecular results
      highlighted that for both bacteria and fungi the pollutant had a partial shaping 
      effect on the enriched communities, with paraffin creating distinct enriched
      bacterial community from oil, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generally
      overlapping; interestingly neither the soil depth or the enrichment step had
      significant effects on the composition of the final enriched communities.
      Molecular analyses well-agreed with culture-dependent analyses in terms of most
      abundant microbial genera. A total of 95 bacterial and 94 fungal strains were
      isolated after selective enrichment procedure on different pollutants. On the
      whole, isolated bacteria where manly ascribed to Pseudomonas genus followed by
      Sphingobacterium, Bacillus, Stenothrophomonas, Achromobacter, and Serratia. As
      for fungi, Fusarium was the most abundant genus followed by Trichoderma and
      Aspergillus. The species comprising more isolates, such as Pseudomonas putida,
      Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Ochromobactrum anthropi for bacteria, Fusarium
      oxysporum and Fusarium solani for fungi, were also the dominant OTUs assessed in 
      Illumina.

TI  - A low-gluten diet induces changes in the intestinal microbiome of healthy Danish 
      adults.
PG  - 4630
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07019-x [doi]
AB  - Adherence to a low-gluten diet has become increasingly common in parts of the
      general population. However, the effects of reducing gluten-rich food items
      including wheat, barley and rye cereals in healthy adults are unclear. Here, we
      undertook a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial involving 60 middle-aged
      Danish adults without known disorders with two 8-week interventions comparing a
      low-gluten diet (2 g gluten per day) and a high-gluten diet (18 g gluten per
      day), separated by a washout period of at least six weeks with habitual diet (12 
      g gluten per day). We find that, in comparison with a high-gluten diet, a
      low-gluten diet induces moderate changes in the intestinal microbiome, reduces
      fasting and postprandial hydrogen exhalation, and leads to improvements in
      self-reported bloating. These observations suggest that most of the effects of a 
      low-gluten diet in non-coeliac adults may be driven by qualitative changes in
      dietary fibres.

AB  - In recent years there has been a revolution regarding the role of the microbiota 
      in different diseases, most of them within the spectrum of inflammatory and
      autoimmune diseases, associated with the development of metagenomics and the
      concept of holobiont, a large organism together with its microbiota.
      Specifically, in Multiple Sclerosis, multiple evidence points to the role of the 
      microbiota in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model of the
      disease, and several articles have been published in recent years about
      differences in intestinal microbiota among patients with multiple sclerosis and
      control subjects. We review in this article the concept of holobiont and the gut 
      microbiota functions, as well as the evidence accumulated about the role of the
      microbiota in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.
      Nowadays, there is a lot of evidence showing the role of the microbiota in the
      genesis, prevention and treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
      based mainly on three immunological pillars, the Th1-Th17 / Th2 balance, the Treg
      cells and the humoral immunity. It is also well documented that there are
      differences in the microbiota of patients with MS that are associated with a
      different expression of genes related to inflammation.

TI  - Effects of Intraoperative Vagal Nerve Stimulation on the Gastrointestinal
      Microbiome in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
PG  - 452-460

AB  - The gastrointestinal microbiota (GM) plays a fundamental role in health and
      disease and contributes to the bidirectional signaling between the
      gastrointestinal system and brain. The direct line of communication between these
      organ systems is through the vagus nerve. Therefore, vagal nerve stimulation
      (VNS), a commonly used technique for multiple disorders, has potential to
      modulate the enteric microbiota, enabling investigation and possibly treatment of
      numerous neurologic disorders in which the microbiota has been linked with
      disease. Here we investigate the effect of VNS in a mouse model of amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)(dl)1Gur (SOD1(dl)) and wildtype mice
      underwent ventral neck surgery to access the vagus nerve. During surgery, the
      experimental group received 1 h of VNS, whereas the sham group underwent 1 h of
      sham treatment. The third (control) group did not undergo any surgical
      manipulation. Fecal samples were collected before surgery and at 8 d after the
      initial collection. Microbial DNA was sequenced to determine the GM profiles at
      both time points. GM profiles did not differ between genotypes at either the
      initial or end point. In addition, VNS did not alter GM populations, according to
      the parameters chosen in this study, indicating that this short intraoperative
      treatment is safe and has no lasting effects on the GM. Future studies are
      warranted to determine whether different stimulation parameters or chronic use of
      VNS affect GM profiles.

TI  - Succession and persistence of microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance 
      genes associated with International Space Station environmental surfaces.
PG  - 204
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0585-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) is an ideal test bed for
      studying the effects of microbial persistence and succession on a closed system
      during long space flight. Culture-based analyses, targeted gene-based amplicon
      sequencing (bacteriome, mycobiome, and resistome), and shotgun metagenomics
      approaches have previously been performed on ISS environmental sample sets using 
      whole genome amplification (WGA). However, this is the first study reporting on
      the metagenomes sampled from ISS environmental surfaces without the use of WGA.
      Metagenome sequences generated from eight defined ISS environmental locations in 
      three consecutive flights were analyzed to assess the succession and persistence 
      of microbial communities, their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, and
      virulence properties. Metagenomic sequences were produced from the samples
      treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to measure intact microorganisms. RESULTS:
      The intact microbial communities detected in Flight 1 and Flight 2 samples were
      significantly more similar to each other than to Flight 3 samples. Among 318
      microbial species detected, 46 species constituting 18 genera were common in all 
      flight samples. Risk group or biosafety level 2 microorganisms that persisted
      among all three flights were Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus
      aureus, Yersinia frederiksenii, and Aspergillus lentulus. Even though Rhodotorula
      and Pantoea dominated the ISS microbiome, Pantoea exhibited succession and
      persistence. K. pneumoniae persisted in one location (US Node 1) of all three
      flights and might have spread to six out of the eight locations sampled on Flight
      3. The AMR signatures associated with beta-lactam, cationic antimicrobial
      peptide, and vancomycin were detected. Prominent virulence factors were
      cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance and multidrug-resistance efflux pumps.
      CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in AMR and virulence gene factors detected
      over the period sampled, and metagenome sequences of human pathogens persisted
      over time. Comparative analysis of the microbial compositions of ISS with Earth
      analogs revealed that the ISS environmental surfaces were different in microbial 
      composition. Metagenomics coupled with PMA treatment would help future space
      missions to estimate problematic risk group microbial pathogens. Cataloging
      AMR/virulence characteristics, succession, accumulation, and persistence of
      microorganisms would facilitate the development of suitable countermeasures to
      reduce their presence in the closed built environment.

TI  - MDPbiome: microbiome engineering through prescriptive perturbations.
PG  - i838-i847
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty562 [doi]
AB  - Motivation: Recent microbiome dynamics studies highlight the current inability to
      predict the effects of external perturbations on complex microbial populations.
      To do so would be particularly advantageous in fields such as medicine,
      bioremediation or industrial scenarios. Results: MDPbiome statistically models
      longitudinal metagenomics samples undergoing perturbations as a Markov Decision
      Process (MDP). Given a starting microbial composition, our MDPbiome system
      suggests the sequence of external perturbation(s) that will engineer that
      microbiome to a goal state, for example, a healthier or more performant
      composition. It also estimates intermediate microbiome states along the path,
      thus making it possible to avoid particularly undesirable/unhealthy states. We
      demonstrate MDPbiome performance over three real and distinct datasets, proving
      its flexibility, and the reliability and universality of its output 'optimal
      perturbation policy'. For example, an MDP created using a vaginal microbiome time
      series, with a goal of recovering from bacterial vaginosis, suggested avoidance
      of perturbations such as lubricants or sex toys; while another MDP provided a
      quantitative explanation for why salmonella vaccine accelerates gut microbiome
      maturation in chicks. This novel analytical approach has clear applications in
      medicine, where it could suggest low-impact clinical interventions that will lead
      to achievement or maintenance of a healthy microbial population, or alternately, 
      the sequence of interventions necessary to avoid strongly negative microbiome
      states. Availability and implementation: Code

      (https://tomdelarosa.shinyapps.io/MDPbiome/) are available online. Supplementary

TI  - DREAM-Yara: an exact read mapper for very large databases with short update time.
PG  - i766-i772
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty567 [doi]
AB  - Motivation: Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to 
      very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large
      databases (e.g. >10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that 
      need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to
      reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of 
      the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text
      index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index
      takes about 1 day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely
      performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while 
      preserving fast search times. Results: To solve the index construction and update
      problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index)
      framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the
      introduction of an approximate search distributor via a novel use of Bloom
      filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and
      use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases
      where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices 
      which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search 
      time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a
      distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.

      sequencing samples.
PG  - i715-i721
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty595 [doi]
AB  - Motivation: Next generation sequencing (NGS) has provided researchers with a
      powerful tool to characterize metagenomic and clinical samples in research and
      diagnostic settings. NGS allows an open view into samples useful for pathogen
      detection in an unbiased fashion and without prior hypothesis about possible
      causative agents. However, NGS datasets for pathogen detection come with
      different obstacles, such as a very unfavorable ratio of pathogen to host reads. 
      Alongside often appearing false positives and irrelevant organisms, such as
      contaminants, tools are often challenged by samples with low pathogen loads and
      might not report organisms present below a certain threshold. Furthermore, some
      metagenomic profiling tools are only focused on one particular set of pathogens, 
      for example bacteria. Results: We present PAIPline, a bioinformatics pipeline
      specifically designed to address problems associated with detecting pathogens in 
      diagnostic samples. PAIPline particularly focuses on userfriendliness and
      encapsulates all necessary steps from preprocessing to resolution of ambiguous
      reads and filtering up to visualization in a single tool. In contrast to existing
      tools, PAIPline is more specific while maintaining sensitivity. This is shown in 
      a comparative evaluation where PAIPline was benchmarked along other well-known
      metagenomic profiling tools on previously published well-characterized datasets. 
      Additionally, as part of an international cooperation project, PAIPline was
      applied to an outbreak sample of hemorrhagic fevers of then unknown etiology. The
      presented results show that PAIPline can serve as a robust, reliable,
      user-friendly, adaptable and generalizable stand-alone software for diagnostics
      from NGS samples and as a stepping stone for further downstream analyses.

      relatively limited. Methods: From April 2017 to December 2017, 511 specimens were
      collected, and their retrospective diagnoses were classified into infectious
      disease (347 [67.9%]), noninfectious disease (119 [23.3%]), and unknown cases (45
      [8.8%]). The diagnostic performance of pathogens was compared between mNGS and
      culture. The effect of antibiotic exposure on detection rate was also assessed.
      Results: The sensitivity and specificity of mNGS for diagnosing infectious
      disease were 50.7% and 85.7%, respectively, and these values outperformed those
      of culture, especially for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (odds ratio [OR], 4 [95%
      confidence interval {CI}, 1.7-10.8]; P < .01), viruses (mNGS only; P < .01),
      anaerobes (OR, infinity [95% CI, 1.71-infinity]; P < .01) and fungi (OR, 4.0 [95%
      CI, 1.6-10.3]; P < .01). Importantly, for mNGS-positive cases where the
      conventional method was inconclusive, 43 (61%) cases led to diagnosis
      modification, and 41 (58%) cases were not covered by empirical antibiotics. For
      cases where viruses were identified, broad-spectrum antibiotics were commonly
      administered (14/27), and 10 of 27 of these cases were suspected to be
      inappropriate. Interestingly, the sensitivity of mNGS was superior to that of
      culture (52.5% vs 34.2%; P < .01) in cases with, but not without, antibiotic
      exposure. Conclusions: mNGS could yield a higher sensitivity for pathogen
      identification and is less affected by prior antibiotic exposure, thereby
      emerging as a promising technology for detecting infectious diseases.

AB  - Increased circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been involved in
      the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance (IR). However, evidence
      relating berberine (BBR), gut microbiota, BCAAs, and IR is limited. Here, we
      showed that BBR could effectively rectify steatohepatitis and glucose intolerance
      in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. BBR reorganized gut microbiota populations under
      both the normal chow diet (NCD) and HFD. Particularly, BBR noticeably decreased
      the relative abundance of BCAA-producing bacteria, including order Clostridiales;
      families Streptococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Prevotellaceae; and genera
      Streptococcus and Prevotella. Compared with the HFD group, predictive
      metagenomics indicated a reduction in the proportion of gut microbiota genes
      involved in BCAA biosynthesis but the enrichment genes for BCAA degradation and
      transport by BBR treatment. Accordingly, the elevated serum BCAAs of HFD group
      were significantly decreased by BBR. Furthermore, the Western blotting results
      implied that BBR could promote the BCAA catabolism in the liver and epididymal
      white adipose tissues of HFD-fed mice by activation of the multienzyme
      branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), whereas by
      inhibition of the phosphorylation state of BCKDHA (E1alpha subunit) and
      branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK). The ex vivo assay
      further confirmed that BBR could increase BCAA catabolism in both AML12
      hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Finally, data from healthy subjects and
      diabetics confirmed that BBR could improve glycemic control and modulate
      circulating BCAAs. Together, our findings clarified BBR improving IR associated
      not only with gut microbiota alteration in BCAA biosynthesis but also with BCAA
      catabolism in liver and adipose tissues.

PG  - 591-604
LID - 10.1007/s11938-018-0207-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Like the rest of the gastrointestinal tract, the small
      intestine is colonised by microbes, but how this "microbiome" affects the immune 
      system and digestive functions has largely been overlooked, especially in the
      "omics" era. Here, we present recent findings that show that the diversity,
      density and interactions of these microbes in the small intestine can play an
      important role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastrointestinal and
      extraintestinal disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Changes in the small intestinal
      mucosa-associated microbiota (SI-MAM) have been shown to occur with inflammatory 
      bowel diseases, functional gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic disorders such
      as obesity and type 2 diabetes. More recently, there is emerging evidence that
      small intestinal dysbiosis can be a driver for the progression of chronic liver
      disease. Initially believed that small intestinal dysbiosis (e.g. SIBO) is mainly
      due to alterations of luminal conditions (e.g. after surgical resections of the
      ileocecal valve), there is now enough evidence to conclude that small intestinal 
      dysbiosis can occur without underlying structural abnormalities. Alterations of
      the SI-MAM appear to play a key role for the manifestation and progression of
      inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

TI  - Novel Ethanol- and 5-Hydroxymethyl Furfural-Stimulated beta-Glucosidase Retrieved
      From a Brazilian Secondary Atlantic Forest Soil Metagenome.
PG  - 2556
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02556 [doi]
AB  - Beta-glucosidases are key enzymes involved in lignocellulosic biomass degradation
      for bioethanol production, which complete the final step during cellulose
      hydrolysis by converting cellobiose into glucose. Currently, industry requires
      enzymes with improved catalytic performance or tolerance to process-specific
      parameters. In this sense, metagenomics has become a powerful tool for accessing 
      and exploring the biochemical biodiversity present in different natural
      environments. Here, we report the identification of a novel beta-glucosidase from
      metagenomic DNA isolated from soil samples enriched with decaying plant matter
      from a Secondary Atlantic Forest region. For this, we employed a functional
      screening approach using an optimized and synthetic broad host-range vector for
      library production. The novel beta-glucosidase - named Lfa2 - displays three
      GH3-family conserved domains and conserved catalytic amino acids D283 and E487.
      The purified enzyme was most active in pH 5.5 and at 50 degrees C, and showed
      hydrolytic activity toward several pNP synthetic substrates containing
      beta-glucose, beta-galactose, beta-xylose, beta-fucose, and
      alpha-arabinopyranose, as well as toward cellobiose. Lfa2 showed considerable
      glucose tolerance, exhibiting an IC50 of 300 mM glucose and 30% of remaining
      activity in 600 mM glucose. In addition, Lfa2 retained full or slightly enhanced 
      activity in the presence of several metal ions. Further, beta-glucosidase
      activity was increased by 1.7-fold in the presence of 10% (v/v) ethanol, a
      concentration that can be reached in conventional fermentation processes.
      Similarly, Lfa2 showed 1.7-fold enhanced activity at high concentrations of
      5-hydroxymethyl furfural, one of the most important cellulase inhibitors in
      pretreated sugarcane bagasse hydrolysates. Moreover, the synergistic effect of
      Lfa2 on Bacillus subtilis GH5-CBM3 endoglucanase activity was demonstrated by the
      increased production of glucose (1.6-fold). Together, these results indicate that
      beta-glucosidase Lfa2 is a promissory enzyme candidate for utilization in diverse
      industrial applications, such as cellulosic biomass degradation or flavor
      enhancement in winemaking and grape processing.

TI  - A Cross-Scale Neutral Theory Approach to the Influence of Obesity on Community
      Assembly of Human Gut Microbiome.
PG  - 2320
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02320 [doi]
AB  - Background: The implications of gut microbiome to obesity have been extensively
      investigated in recent years although the exact mechanism is still unclear. The
      question whether or not obesity influences gut microbiome assembly has not been
      addressed. The question is significant because it is fundamental for
      investigating the diversity maintenance and stability of gut microbiome, and the 
      latter should hold a key for understanding the etiological implications of gut
      microbiome to obesity. Methods: In this study, we adopt a dual neutral theory
      modeling strategy to address this question from both species and community
      perspectives, with both discrete and continuous neutral theory models. The first 
      neutral theory model we apply is Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity that
      has been extensively tested in macro-ecology of plants and animals, and the
      second we apply is Sloan's neutral theory model that was developed particularly
      for microbial communities based on metagenomic sequencing data. Both the neutral 
      models are complementary to each other and integrated together offering a
      comprehensive approach to more accurately revealing the possible influence of
      obesity on gut microbiome assembly. This is not only because the focus of both
      neutral theory models is different (community vs. species), but also because they
      adopted two different modeling strategies (discrete vs. continuous). Results: We 
      test both the neutral theory models with datasets from Turnbaugh et al. (2009).
      Our tests showed that the species abundance distributions of more than (1/2)
      species (59-69%) in gut microbiome satisfied the prediction of Sloan's neutral
      theory, although at the community level, the number of communities satisfied the 
      Hubbell's neutral theory was negligible (2 out of 278). Conclusion: The
      apparently contradictory findings above suggest that both stochastic neutral
      effects and deterministic environmental (host) factors play important roles in
      shaping the assembly and diversity of gut microbiome. Furthermore, obesity may
      just be one of the host factors, but its influence may not be strong enough to
      tip the balance between stochastic and deterministic forces that shape the
      community assembly. Finally, the apparent contradiction from both the neutral
      theories should not be surprising given that there are still near 30-40% species 
      that do not obey the neutral law.

AB  - The accurate quantification of microbial growth dynamics for species without
      complete genome sequences is biologically important, but computationally
      challenging in metagenomics. Here we present dynamic estimator of microbial
      communities (DEMIC; https://sourceforge.net/projects/demic/ ), a multi-sample
      algorithm based on contigs and coverage values, to infer the relative distances
      of contigs from the replication origin and to accurately compare bacterial growth
      rates between samples. We demonstrate robust performances of DEMIC for various
      sample sizes and assembly qualities using multiple synthetic and real datasets.

TI  - Increased virulence of the oral microbiome in oral squamous cell carcinoma
      revealed by metatranscriptome analyses.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1038/s41368-018-0037-7 [doi]
AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent and most commonly
      studied oral cancer. However, there is a void regarding the role that the oral
      microbiome may play in OSCC. Although the relationship between microbial
      community composition and OSCC has been thoroughly investigated, microbial
      profiles of the human microbiome in cancer are understudied. Here we performed a 
      small pilot study of community-wide metatranscriptome analysis to profile mRNA
      expression in the entire oral microbiome in OSCC to reveal molecular functions
      associated with this disease. Fusobacteria showed a statistically significantly
      higher number of transcripts at tumour sites and tumour-adjacent sites of cancer 
      patients compared to the healthy controls analysed. Regardless of the community
      composition, specific metabolic signatures were consistently found in disease.
      Activities such as iron ion transport, tryptophanase activity, peptidase
      activities and superoxide dismutase were over-represented in tumour and
      tumour-adjacent samples when compared to the healthy controls. The expression of 
      putative virulence factors in the oral communities associated with OSCC showed
      that activities related to capsule biosynthesis, flagellum synthesis and
      assembly, chemotaxis, iron transport, haemolysins and adhesins were upregulated
      at tumour sites. Moreover, activities associated with protection against reactive
      nitrogen intermediates, chemotaxis, flagellar and capsule biosynthesis were also 
      upregulated in non-tumour sites of cancer patients. Although they are
      preliminary, our results further suggest that Fusobacteria may be the leading
      phylogenetic group responsible for the increase in expression of virulence
      factors in the oral microbiome of OSCC patients.

AB  - Dysbiosis i.e. changes in microbial composition at a mucosal interface, is
      implicated in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
      diseases. To assess the composition of the microbial upper respiratory tract
      (URT) community in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), we used 
      culture-independent high-throughput methods. In this prospective clinical study, 
      nasal swabs were collected from patients with GPA, patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA, disease control), and healthy controls. Nasal bacterial taxa were 
      assessed using V3-V4 region 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Haemophilus influenza, and entero- and rhinoviruses were detected using qPCR.
      Unbiased metagenomic RNA sequencing (UMERS) was performed in a subset of samples 
      to determine the relative abundance of bacterial, fungal, and viral species. A
      trend toward reduced microbiome diversity was detected in GPA samples compared
      with healthy controls. The abundance of bacterial taxa and microbial richness
      were significantly decreased in GPA samples compared with RA samples. The
      relative abundance of bacterial families shifted, with increased Planococcaceae
      and decreased Moraxellaceae, Tissierellaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and
      Propionibacteriaceae in GPA and RA. Further, decreased abundance of
      Corynebacteriaceae, and Aerococcaceae was observed in GPA samples. Significantly 
      more colonization of S. aureus was seen in the nasal microbiome of GPA compared
      with RA and healthy control samples. H. influenzae colonization was also observed
      in GPA samples. UMERS detected the presence of rhinoviral sequences in some GPA
      samples. Thus, our study uncovered changes in the URT microbial composition in
      patients with GPA and RA, suggesting that both immunosuppression and disease
      background affect the URT microbiome. Complex alterations of host-microbiome
      interactions in the URT could influence chronic endonasal inflammation in GPA.

TI  - Dynamic linear models guide design and analysis of microbiota studies within
      artificial human guts.
PG  - 202
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0584-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial gut models provide unique opportunities to study
      human-associated microbiota. Outstanding questions for these models' fundamental 
      biology include the timescales on which microbiota vary and the factors that
      drive such change. Answering these questions though requires overcoming
      analytical obstacles like estimating the effects of technical variation on
      observed microbiota dynamics, as well as the lack of appropriate benchmark
      datasets. RESULTS: To address these obstacles, we created a modeling framework
      based on multinomial logistic-normal dynamic linear models (MALLARDs) and
      performed dense longitudinal sampling of four replicate artificial human guts
      over the course of 1 month. The resulting analyses revealed how the ratio of
      biological variation to technical variation from sample processing depends on
      sampling frequency. In particular, we find that at hourly sampling frequencies,
      76% of observed variation could be ascribed to technical sources, which could
      also skew the observed covariation between taxa. We also found that the
      artificial guts demonstrated replicable trajectories even after a recovery from a
      transient feed disruption. Additionally, we observed irregular sub-daily
      oscillatory dynamics associated with the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae
      within all four replicate vessels. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that, beyond
      variation due to sequence counting, technical variation from sample processing
      can obscure temporal variation from biological sources in artificial gut studies.
      Our analyses also supported hypotheses that human gut microbiota fluctuates on
      sub-daily timescales in the absence of a host and that microbiota can follow
      replicable trajectories in the presence of environmental driving forces. Finally,
      multiple aspects of our approach are generalizable and could ultimately be used
      to facilitate the design and analysis of longitudinal microbiota studies in vivo.

LID - 10.1142/S0219720018400218 [doi]
AB  - Metagenomic studies identify the species present in an environmental sample
      usually by using procedures that match molecular sequences, e.g. genes, with the 
      species taxonomy. Here, we first formulate the problem of gene-species matching
      in the parsimony framework using binary phylogenetic gene and species trees under
      the deep coalescence cost and the assumption that each gene is paired uniquely
      with one species. In particular, we solve the problem in the cases when one of
      the trees is a caterpillar. Next, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm,
      which solves the problem exactly, however, its time and space complexity is
      exponential. Next, we generalize the problem to include non-binary trees and show
      the solution for caterpillar trees. We then propose time and space-efficient
      heuristic algorithms for solving the gene-species matching problem for any input 
      trees. Finally, we present the results of computational experiments on simulated 
      and empirical datasets consisting of binary tree pairs.

TI  - eggNOG 5.0: a hierarchical, functionally and phylogenetically annotated orthology
      resource based on 5090 organisms and 2502 viruses.
PG  - D309-D314
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1085 [doi]
AB  - eggNOG is a public database of orthology relationships, gene evolutionary
      histories and functional annotations. Here, we present version 5.0, featuring a
      major update of the underlying genome sets, which have been expanded to 4445
      representative bacteria and 168 archaea derived from 25 038 genomes, as well as
      477 eukaryotic organisms and 2502 viral proteomes that were selected for
      diversity and filtered by genome quality. In total, 4.4M orthologous groups (OGs)
      distributed across 379 taxonomic levels were computed together with their
      associated sequence alignments, phylogenies, HMM models and functional
      descriptors. Precomputed evolutionary analysis provides fine-grained resolution
      of duplication/speciation events within each OG. Our benchmarks show that,
      despite doubling the amount of genomes, the quality of orthology assignments and 
      functional annotations (80% coverage) has persisted without significant changes
      across this update. Finally, we improved eggNOG online services for fast
      functional annotation and orthology prediction of custom genomics or metagenomics
      datasets. All precomputed data are publicly available for downloading or via API 
      queries at http://eggnog.embl.de.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Metagenomics is a powerful tool for assaying the DNA from every
      genome present in an environment. Recent advances in bioinformatics have enabled 
      the rapid assembly of near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and
      there is a need for reproducible pipelines that can annotate and characterize
      thousands of genomes simultaneously, to enable identification and functional
      characterization. RESULTS: Here we present MAGpy, a scalable and reproducible
      pipeline that takes multiple genome assemblies as FASTA and compares them to
      several public databases, checks quality, suggests a taxonomy and draws a
      phylogenetic tree. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MAGpy is available on github:
      https://github.com/WatsonLab/MAGpy. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data
      are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Iron deficiency anemia-related gut microbiota dysbiosis in infants and young
      children: A pilot study.
PG  - 551-564
LID - 10.1556/030.65.2018.045 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional iron deficiency (ID) causes not only anemia but also malfunction of
      the entire human organism. Recently, a role of the gut microbiota has been
      hypothesized, but limited data are available especially in infants. Here, we
      performed a pilot study to explore the gut microbiota in 10 patients with iron
      deficiency anemia (IDA) and 10 healthy controls aged 6-34 months. Fresh stool
      samples were collected from diapers, and the fecal microbiota was profiled by
      next-generation sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA
      gene. Except for diet diversity, the breastfeeding status at the enrollment, the 
      exclusive breastfeeding duration, and the introduction of complementary foods did
      not differ between groups. Distinct microbial signatures were found in IDA
      patients, with increased relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (mean relative 
      abundance, patients vs. controls, 4.4% vs. 3.0%) and Veillonellaceae (13.7% vs.
      3.6%), and reduced abundance of Coriobacteriaceae (3.5% vs. 8.8%) compared to
      healthy controls. A decreased Bifidobacteriaceae/Enterobacteriaceae ratio was
      observed in IDA patients. Notwithstanding the low sample size, our data highlight
      microbiota dysbalance in IDA worth for further investigations, aimed at
      unraveling the ID impact on the microbiome trajectory in early life, and the
      possible long-term consequences.

TI  - Quasi-metagenomic Analysis of Salmonella from Food and Environmental Samples.
LID - 10.3791/58612 [doi]
AB  - Quasi-metagenomics sequencing refers to the sequencing-based analysis of modified
      microbiomes of food and environmental samples. In this protocol, microbiome
      modification is designed to concentrate genomic DNA of a target foodborne
      pathogen contaminant to facilitate the detection and subtyping of the pathogen in
      a single workflow. Here, we explain and demonstrate the sample preparation steps 
      for the quasi-metagenomics analysis of Salmonella enterica from representative
      food and environmental samples including alfalfa sprouts, ground black pepper,
      ground beef, chicken breast and environmental swabs. Samples are first subjected 
      to the culture enrichment of Salmonella for a shortened and adjustable duration
      (4-24 h). Salmonella cells are then selectively captured from the enrichment
      culture by immunomagnetic separation (IMS). Finally, multiple displacement
      amplification (MDA) is performed to amplify DNA from IMS-captured cells. The DNA 
      output of this protocol can be sequenced by high throughput sequencing platforms.
      An optional quantitative PCR analysis can be performed to replace sequencing for 
      Salmonella detection or assess the concentration of Salmonella DNA before
      sequencing.

TI  - Influence of Feeding Type and Nosema ceranae Infection on the Gut Microbiota of
      Apis cerana Workers.
LID - e00177-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00177-18 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota plays an essential role in the health of bees. To elucidate
      the effect of feed and Nosema ceranae infection on the gut microbiota of honey
      bee (Apis cerana), we used 16S rRNA sequencing to survey the gut microbiota of
      honey bee workers fed with sugar water or beebread and inoculated with or without
      N. ceranae. The gut microbiota of A. cerana is dominated by Serratia,
      Snodgrassella, and Lactobacillus genera. The overall gut microbiota diversity was
      show to be significantly differential by feeding type. N. ceranae infection
      significantly affects the gut microbiota only in bees fed with sugar water.
      Higher abundances of Lactobacillus, Gluconacetobacter, and Snodgrassella and
      lower abundances of Serratia were found in bees fed with beebread than in those
      fed with sugar water. N. ceranae infection led to a higher abundance of
      Snodgrassella and a lower abundance of Serratia in sugar-fed bees. Imputed
      bacterial Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed the
      significant metagenomics functional differences by feeding and N. ceranae
      infections. Furthermore, A. cerana workers fed with sugar water showed lower N.
      ceranae spore loads but higher mortality than those fed with beebread. The
      cumulative mortality was strongly positive correlated (rho = 0.61) with the
      changes of overall microbiota dissimilarities by N. ceranae infection. Both
      feeding types and N. ceranae infection significantly affect the gut microbiota in
      A. cerana workers. Beebread not only provides better nutrition but also helps
      establish a more stable gut microbiota and therefore protects bees in response to
      N. ceranae infection. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiota plays an essential role in
      the health of bees. Scientific evidence suggests that diet and infection can
      affect the gut microbiota and modulate the health of the gut; however, the
      interplay between those two factors and the bee gut microbiota is not well known.
      In this study, we used a high-throughput sequencing method to monitor the changes
      of gut microbiota associated with both feeding types and Nosema ceranae
      infection. Our results showed that the gut microbiota composition and diversity
      of Asian honey bee were significantly associated with both feeding types and the 
      N. ceranae infection. More interestingly, bees fed with beebread showed higher
      microbiota stability and lower mortality rates than those fed with sugar water
      when infected by N. ceranae. Those data suggest that beebread has the potential
      not only to provide better nutrition but also help to establish a more stable gut
      microbiota to protect bees against N. ceranae infection.

LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00113-18 [doi]
AB  - The 2,3-seco pathway, the pathway for anaerobic cholesterol degradation, has been
      established in the denitrifying betaproteobacterium Sterolibacterium
      denitrificans. However, knowledge of how microorganisms respond to cholesterol at
      the community level is elusive. Here, we applied mesocosm incubation and 16S rRNA
      sequencing to reveal that, in denitrifying sludge communities, three
      betaproteobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with low (94% to 95%) 16S 
      rRNA sequence similarity to Stl. denitrificans are cholesterol degraders and
      members of the rare biosphere. Metatranscriptomic and metabolite analyses show
      that these degraders adopt the 2,3-seco pathway to sequentially catalyze the side
      chain and sterane of cholesterol and that two molybdoenzymes-steroid C25
      dehydrogenase and 1-testosterone dehydrogenase/hydratase-are crucial for these
      bioprocesses, respectively. The metatranscriptome further suggests that these
      betaproteobacterial degraders display chemotaxis and motility toward cholesterol 
      and that FadL-like transporters may be the key components for substrate uptake.
      Also, these betaproteobacteria are capable of transporting micronutrients and
      synthesizing cofactors essential for cellular metabolism and cholesterol
      degradation; however, the required cobalamin is possibly provided by cobalamin-de
      novo-synthesizing gamma-, delta-, and betaproteobacteria via the salvage pathway.
      Overall, our results indicate that the ability to degrade cholesterol in sludge
      communities is reserved for certain rare biosphere members and that C25
      dehydrogenase can serve as a biomarker for sterol degradation in anoxic
      environments. IMPORTANCE Steroids are ubiquitous and abundant natural compounds
      that display recalcitrance. Biodegradation via sludge communities in wastewater
      treatment plants is the primary removal process for steroids. To date, compared
      to studies for aerobic steroid degradation, the knowledge of anaerobic
      degradation of steroids has been based on only a few model organisms. Due to the 
      increase of anthropogenic impacts, steroid inputs may affect microbial diversity 
      and functioning in ecosystems. Here, we first investigated microbial functional
      responses to cholesterol, the most abundant steroid in sludge, at the community
      level. Our metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses revealed that the
      capacities for cholesterol approach, uptake, and degradation are unique traits of
      certain low-abundance betaproteobacteria, indicating the importance of the rare
      biosphere in bioremediation. Apparent expression of genes involved in cofactor de
      novo synthesis and salvage pathways suggests that these micronutrients play
      important roles for cholesterol degradation in sludge communities.

TI  - Transcriptionally Active Lung Microbiome and Its Association with Bacterial
      Biomass and Host Inflammatory Status.
LID - e00199-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00199-18 [doi]
AB  - Alteration of the lung microbiome has been observed in several respiratory tract 
      diseases. However, most previous studies were based on 16S ribosomal RNA and
      shotgun metagenome sequencing; the viability and functional activity of the
      microbiome, as well as its interaction with host immune systems, have not been
      well studied. To characterize the active lung microbiome and its associations
      with host immune response and clinical features, we applied metatranscriptome
      sequencing to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 25 patients with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and from nine control cases without 
      known pulmonary disease. Community structure analyses revealed three distinct
      microbial compositions, which were significantly correlated with bacterial
      biomass, human Th17 immune response, and COPD exacerbation frequency.
      Specifically, samples with transcriptionally active Streptococcus, Rothia, or
      Pseudomonas had bacterial loads 16 times higher than samples enriched for
      Escherichia and Ralstonia. These high-bacterial-load samples also tended to
      undergo a stronger Th17 immune response. Furthermore, an increased proportion of 
      lymphocytes was found in samples with active Pseudomonas. In addition, COPD
      patients with active Streptococcus or Rothia infections tended to have lower
      rates of exacerbations than patients with active Pseudomonas and patients with
      lower bacterial biomass. Our results support the idea of a stratified structure
      of the active lung microbiome and a significant host-microbe interaction. We
      speculate that diverse lung microbiomes exist in the population and that their
      presence and activities could either influence or reflect different aspects of
      lung health. IMPORTANCE Recent studies of the microbiome proposed that resident
      microbes play a beneficial role in maintaining human health. Although lower
      respiratory tract disease is a leading cause of sickness and mortality, how the
      lung microbiome interacts with human health remains largely unknown. Here we
      assessed the association between the lung microbiome and host gene expression,
      cytokine concentration, and over 20 clinical features. Intriguingly, we found a
      stratified structure of the active lung microbiome which was significantly
      associated with bacterial biomass, lymphocyte proportion, human Th17 immune
      response, and COPD exacerbation frequency. These observations suggest that the
      microbiome plays a significant role in lung homeostasis. Not only microbial
      composition but also active functional elements and host immunity characteristics
      differed among different individuals. Such diversity may partially account for
      the variation in susceptibility to particular diseases.

AB  - Intestinal bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD). Recently developed microbial profiling techniques are beginning 
      to shed light on the nature of the changes in the gut microbiota that accompany
      NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this review, we summarize the 
      role of gut microbiota in the development of NAFLD, NASH, and hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). We highlight the mechanisms by which gut microbiota contribute
      to NAFLD/NASH, including through alterations in gut epithelial permeability,
      choline metabolism, endogenous alcohol production, release of inflammatory
      cytokines, regulation of hepatic Toll-like receptor (TLR), and bile acid
      metabolism. In addition, we analyze possible mechanisms for enhanced hepatic
      carcinogenesis, including alterations in bile acid metabolism, release of
      inflammatory cytokines, and expression of TLR-4. Finally, we describe therapeutic
      approaches for NAFLD/NASH and preventive strategies for HCC involving modulation 
      of the intestinal microbiota or affected host pathways. Although recent studies
      have provided useful information, large-scale prospective studies are required to
      better characterize the intestinal microbiota and metabolome, in order to
      demonstrate a causative role for changes in the gut microbiota in the etiology of
      NAFLD/NASH, to identify new therapeutic strategies for NAFLD/NASH, and to develop
      more effective methods of preventing HCC.

TI  - GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC CAUSES OF OBESITY.
PG  - 379-405
AB  - Obesity is a complex, heritable trait influenced by the interplay of genetics,
      epigenetics, metagenomics and the environment. With the increasing access to high
      precision diagnostic tools for genetic investigations, numerous genes influencing
      the phenotype have been identified, especially in early onset severe obesity.
      This review summarizes the current knowledge on the known genetic causes of
      obesity and the available therapeutic options. Furthermore, we discuss the role
      and potential mechanism of epigenetic changes that may be involved as mediators
      of the environmental influences and that may provide future opportunities for
      intervention.

AB  - It is widely assumed that there is a clear distinction between eukaryotes, with
      cell nuclei, and prokaryotes, which lack nuclei. This suggests the evolution of
      nuclear compartmentation is a singular event. However, emerging knowledge of the 
      diversity of bacterial internal cell structures suggests the picture may not be
      as black-and-white as previously thought. For instance, some members of the
      bacterial PVC superphylum appear to have nucleus-like compartmentation, where
      transcription and translation are physically separated, and some jumbophages have
      recently been shown to create nucleus-like structures within their Pseudomonad
      hosts. Moreover, there is also tantalizing metagenomic identification of new
      Archaea that carry homologs of genes associated with internal cell membrane
      structure in eukaryotes. All these cases invite comparison with eukaryote cell
      biology. While the bacterial cases of genetic compartmentation are likely
      convergent, and thus viewed by many as not germane to the question of eukaryote
      origins, we argue here that, in addressing the broader question of the evolution 
      of compartmentation, other instances are at least as important: they provide us
      with a point of comparison which is critical for a more general understanding of 
      both the conditions favoring the emergence of intracellular compartmentation of
      DNA and the evolutionary consequences of such cellular architecture. Finally, we 
      consider three classes of explanation for the emergence of compartmentation:
      physical protection, crosstalk avoidance and nonadaptive origins.

TI  - Structural and Functional Interrogation of Selected Biological Nitrogen Removal
      Systems in the United States, Denmark, and Singapore Using Shotgun Metagenomics.

AB  - Conventional biological nitrogen removal (BNR), comprised of nitrification and
      denitrification, is traditionally employed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
      to prevent eutrophication in receiving water bodies. More recently, the
      combination of selective ammonia to nitrite oxidation (nitritation) and
      autotrophic anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), collectively termed
      deammonification, has also emerged as a possible energy- and cost-effective BNR
      alternative. Herein, we analyzed microbial diversity and functional potential
      within 13 BNR processes in the United States, Denmark, and Singapore operated
      with varying reactor configuration, design, and operational parameters. Using
      next-generation sequencing and metagenomics, gene-coding regions were aligned
      against a custom protein database expanded to include all published aerobic
      ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB), anaerobic
      ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AMX), and complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria (CMX). 
      Overall contributions of these N-cycle bacteria to the total functional potential
      of each reactor was determined, as well as that of several organisms associated
      with denitrification and/or structural integrity of microbial aggregates (biofilm
      or granules). The potential for these engineered processes to foster a broad
      spectrum of microbial catabolic, anabolic, and carbon assimilation
      transformations was elucidated. Seeded sidestream DEMON(R) deammonification
      systems and single-stage nitritation-anammox moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) 
      and a mainstream Cleargreen reactor designed to enrich in AOB and AMX showed
      lower enrichment in AMX functionality than an enriched two-stage
      nitritation-anammox MBBR system treating mainstream wastewater. Conventional BNR 
      systems in Singapore and the United States had distinct metagenomes, especially
      relating to AOB. A hydrocyclone process designed to recycle biomass granules for 
      mainstream BNR contained almost identical structural and functional
      characteristics in the overflow, underflow, and inflow of mixed liquor (ALT)
      rather than the expected selective enrichment of specific nitrifying or AMX
      organisms. Inoculum used to seed a sidestream deammonification process
      unexpectedly contained <10% of total coding regions assigned to AMX. These
      results suggest the operating conditions of engineered bioprocesses shape the
      resident microbial structure and function far more than the bioprocess
      configuration itself. We also highlight the advantage of a systems- and
      metagenomics-based interrogation of both the microbial structure and potential
      function therein over targeting of individual populations or specific genes.

AB  - Conventional water resources are not sufficient in many regions to meet the needs
      of growing populations. Due to cyclical weather cycles, drought, and climate
      change, water stress has increased worldwide including in Southern California,
      which serves as a model for regions that integrate reuse of wastewater for both
      potable and non-potable use. The Orange County Water District (OCWD) Advanced
      Water Purification Facility (AWPF) is a highly engineered system designed to
      treat and produce up to 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of purified water from 
      a municipal wastewater source for potable reuse. Routine facility microbial water
      quality analysis is limited to standard indicators at this and similar
      facilities. Given recent advances in high throughput DNA sequencing techniques,
      complete microbial profiling of communities in water samples is now possible. By 
      using 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing
      coupled to a highly accurate identification method along with 16S rRNA gene qPCR,
      we describe a detailed view of the total microbial community throughout the
      facility. The total bacterial load of the water at stages of the treatment train 
      ranged from 3.02 x 10(6) copies in source, unchlorinated wastewater feed to 5.49 
      x 10(1) copies of 16S rRNA gene/mL after treatment (consisting of
      microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet/advanced oxidation). Microbial 
      diversity and load decreased by several orders of magnitude after microfiltration
      and reverse osmosis treatment, falling to almost non-detectable levels that more 
      closely resembled controls of molecular grade laboratory water than the biomass
      detected in the source water. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes and
      viruses was also greatly reduced. Overall, system design performance was
      achieved, and comprehensive microbial community analysis was found to enable a
      more complete characterization of the water/wastewater microbial signature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alterations in the microbiota composition of the gastro-intestinal
      tract are suspected to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of two closely related
      systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases: primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our objective was to assess whether
      alterations in gut and oral microbiota compositions are specific for pSS and SLE.
      METHODS: 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 39
      pSS patients, 30 SLE patients and 965 individuals from the general population, as
      well as on buccal swab and oral washing samples from the same pSS and SLE
      patients. Alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and relative abundance of individual
      bacteria were used as outcome measures. Multivariate analyses were performed to
      test associations between individual bacteria and disease phenotype, taking age, 
      sex, body-mass index, proton-pump inhibitor use and sequencing-depth into account
      as possible confounding factors. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota composition from pSS
      and SLE patients differed significantly from population controls, but not between
      pSS and SLE. pSS and SLE patients were characterized by lower bacterial richness,
      lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides
      species in fecal samples compared with population controls. Oral microbiota
      composition differed significantly between pSS patients and SLE patients, which
      could partially be explained by oral dryness in pSS patients. CONCLUSIONS: pSS
      and SLE patients share similar alterations in gut microbiota composition,
      distinguishing patients from individuals in the general population, while oral
      microbiota composition shows disease-specific differences between pSS and SLE
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiota and human allergic airway diseases have been proven to be 
      interrelated. Bacteria-derived extracellular vesicle (EV)s are known to play
      important roles in interbacterial and human-bacteria communications, but their
      relationship with allergies has not been examined yet. Urine EVs were
      investigated to determine whether they could be used as biomarkers for monitoring
      allergic airway diseases in children. METHODS: Subjects were 4 groups of chronic 
      rhinitis (CR), allergic rhinitis (AR), atopic asthma (AS) and healthy controls.
      Single voided urine samples were collected. Urine EVs were isolated and their DNA
      was extracted for 16S-rDNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS: A total of 118 children
      participated in this study; 27, 39, 19, and 33 were in the CR, AR, AS, and
      control group, respectively. The AR had a significantly high Chao-1 index than
      that of controls. Principal component analysis revealed dysbiosis in the CR, AR, 
      and AS compared to the controls. One phylum and 19 families and genera were
      significantly enriched or depleted in the disease groups compared to the
      controls; the Actinobacteria phylum and the Sphingomonadaceae family were more
      abundant in the AS and CR, the Comamonadaceae family, the Propionibacteraceae
      family, Propionibacterium and Enhydrobacter were more enriched in the CR, and the
      Methylobacteriaceae family and Methylobacterium were more abundant in each
      disease group, while the Enterobacteriaceae family was depleted in each disease
      group. CONCLUSIONS: CR, AR, and AS had a distinct composition of urine EVs. Urine
      EVs could be an indicator for assessing allergic airway diseases in children.

TI  - nanoDSF as screening tool for enzyme libraries and biotechnology development.
PG  - 184-204
LID - 10.1111/febs.14696 [doi]
AB  - Enzymes are attractive tools for synthetic applications. To be viable for
      industrial use, enzymes need sufficient stability towards the desired reaction
      conditions such as high substrate and cosolvent concentration, non-neutral pH and
      elevated temperatures. Thermal stability is an attractive feature not only
      because it allows for protein purification by thermal treatment and higher
      process temperatures but also due to the associated higher stability against
      other destabilising factors. Therefore, high-throughput screening (HTS) methods
      are desirable for the identification of thermostable biocatalysts by discovery
      from nature or by protein engineering but current methods have low throughput and
      require time-demanding purification of protein samples. We found that nanoscale
      differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) is a valuable tool to rapidly and
      reliably determine melting points of native proteins. To avoid intrinsic problems
      posed by crude protein extracts, hypotonic extraction of overexpressed protein
      from bacterial host cells resulted in higher sample quality and accurate manual
      determination of several hundred melting temperatures per day. We have probed the
      use of nanoDSF for HTS of a phylogenetically diverse aldolase library to identify
      novel thermostable enzymes from metagenomic sources and for the rapid
      measurements of variants from saturation mutagenesis. The feasibility of nanoDSF 
      for the screening of synthetic reaction conditions was proved by studies of
      cosolvent tolerance, which showed protein melting temperature to decrease
      linearly with increasing cosolvent concentration for all combinations of six
      enzymes and eight water-miscible cosolvents investigated, and of substrate
      affinity, which showed stabilisation of hexokinase by sugars in the absence of
      ATP cofactor. ENZYMES: Alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP(+) ) (EC 1.1.1.2),
      transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1), hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate
      aldolase (EC 4.1.2.4), fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.n).

AB  - Analyses across all three domains of life are necessary to advance our
      understanding of taxonomic dysbiosis in human diseases. In the present study, we 
      assessed gut microbiota (eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes) of recurrent
      oxalate kidney stone suffers to explore the extent of trans-domain and functional
      species dysbiosis inside the gut. Trans-domain taxonomic composition, active
      oxalate metabolizer and butyrate-producing diversity were explored by utilizing
      frc-, but-, and buk- functional gene amplicon analysis. Operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs) level analyses confound with the observation that dysbiosis in gut
      microbiota is not just limited to eubacteria species, but also to other domains
      like archaea and eukaryotes. We found that some of healthy eubacterial population
      retained together with Oxalobacter formigenes and Lactobacillus plantarum
      colonization in disease condition (p < 0.001 & FDR = 0.05). Interestingly,
      trans-domain species diversity has been less shared and dysgenic taxa
      augmentation was found to be higher. Oxalate metabolizing bacterial species
      (OMBS) and butyrate-producing eubacteria species were found to be decreased in
      Oxalobacter non-colonizers; and Prevotella and Ruminococcus species which may
      contribute to oxalate metabolism and butyrate synthesis as well. Our study
      underscores fact that microbial dysbiosis is not limited to eubacteria only hence
      suggest the necessity of the trans-domain surveillance in metabolic diseases for 
      intervention studies.

TI  - Exploratory metagenomic analyses of periweaning failure-to-thrive
      syndrome-affected pigs.

AB  - Modern pig farming is characterised by the emergence of several syndromes whose
      aetiology is unclear or has a multifactorial origin, including periweaning
      failure-to-thrive syndrome (PFTS). In fact, its specific aetiology remains
      elusive, although several causes have been investigated over time. The present
      study aimed to investigate the potential role of viral agents in PFTS-affected
      and healthy animals by evaluating the virome composition of different organs
      using a metagenomic approach. This analysis allowed demonstrating a higher
      abundance of Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) in healthy subjects while Ungulate
      bocaparvovirus 2 (BoPV2), Ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (PPV) and Porcine circovirus
      3 (PCV-3) were increased in pigs with PFTS. No differential abundance of RNA
      viruses was found between PFTS-affected and control pigs. Remarkably, this is the
      first molecular characterisation of PPV6 and BoPV2 in Spain and one of the few
      all around the world, supporting their apparent widespread circulation.
      Interestingly, PCV-3 has been recently identified in several
      clinical-pathological conditions as well as in healthy pigs, while BoPV2
      pathogenic potential is unknown. Although obtained results must be taken as
      preliminary, they open the door for further studies on the potential role of
      these viruses or their combination as predisposing factor/s for PFTS occurrence.

TI  - Bioprospecting Reveals Class III omega-Transaminases Converting Bulky Ketones and
      Environmentally Relevant Polyamines.
LID - e02404-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02404-18 [doi]
AB  - Amination of bulky ketones, particularly in (R) configuration, is an attractive
      chemical conversion; however, known omega-transaminases (omega-TAs) show
      insufficient levels of performance. By applying two screening methods, we
      discovered 10 amine transaminases from the class III omega-TA family that were
      38% to 76% identical to homologues. We present examples of such enzymes
      preferring bulky ketones over keto acids and aldehydes with stringent (S)
      selectivity. We also report representatives from the class III omega-TAs capable 
      of converting (R) and (S) amines and bulky ketones and one that can convert
      amines with longer alkyl substituents. The preference for bulky ketones was
      associated with the presence of a hairpin region proximal to the conserved Arg414
      and residues conforming and close to it. The outward orientation of Arg414
      additionally favored the conversion of (R) amines. This configuration was also
      found to favor the utilization of putrescine as an amine donor, so that class III
      omega-TAs with Arg414 in outward orientation may participate in vivo in the
      catabolism of putrescine. The positioning of the conserved Ser231 also
      contributes to the preference for amines with longer alkyl substituents. Optimal 
      temperatures for activity ranged from 45 to 65 degrees C, and a few enzymes
      retained >/=50% of their activity in water-soluble solvents (up to 50%
      [vol/vol]). Hence, our results will pave the way to design, in the future, new
      class III omega-TAs converting bulky ketones and (R) amines for the production of
      high-value products and to screen for those converting putrescine.IMPORTANCE
      Amine transaminases of the class III omega-TAs are key enzymes for modification
      of chemical building blocks, but finding those capable of converting bulky
      ketones and (R) amines is still challenging. Here, by an extensive analysis of
      the substrate spectra of 10 class III omega-TAs, we identified a number of
      residues playing a role in determining the access and positioning of bulky
      ketones, bulky amines, and (R)- and (S) amines, as well as of environmentally
      relevant polyamines, particularly putrescine. The results presented can
      significantly expand future opportunities for designing (R)-specific class III
      omega-TAs to convert valuable bulky ketones and amines, as well as for deepening 
      the knowledge into the polyamine catabolic pathways.

AB  - Antibiotics have been widely spread in the environments, imposing profound stress
      on the resistome of the residing microbes. Marine microbiomes are well
      established large reservoirs of novel antibiotics and corresponding resistance
      genes. The Gulf of Khambhat is known for its extreme tides and complex
      sedimentation process. We performed high throughput sequencing and applied
      bioinformatics techniques on pelagic sediment microbiome across four coordinates 
      of the Gulf of Khambhat to assess the marine resistome, its corresponding
      bacterial community and compared with the open Arabian Sea sample. We identified 
      a total of 2354 unique types of resistance genes, with most abundant and diverse 
      gene profile in the area that had anthropogenic activities being carried out
      on-shore. The genes with >1% abundance in all samples included carA, macB,
      sav1866, tlrC, srmB, taeA, tetA, oleC and bcrA which belonged to the macrolides, 
      glycopeptides and peptide drug classes. ARG enriched phyla distribution was quite
      varying between all the sites, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria
      and Bacteroidetes among the dominant phyla. Based on the outcomes, we also
      propose potential biomarker candidates Desulfovibrio, Thermotaga and Pelobacter
      for antibiotic monitoring in the two of the Gulf samples probable contamination
      prone environments, and genera Nitrosocccus, Marinobacter and Streptomyces in the
      rest of the three studied samples. Outcomes support the concept that ARGs
      naturally originate in environments and human activities contribute to the
      dissemination of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - A metagenomics approach was used to detect novel and recognized RNA viruses in
      mosquitoes from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. A total of 1359 mosquitoes of 7 
      species and 5 genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia and Psorophora) were
      sorted into 37 pools, homogenized and inoculated onto monolayers of Aedes
      albopictus (C6/36) cells. A second blind passage was performed and then total RNA
      was extracted and analysed by RNA-seq. Two novel viruses, designated Uxmal virus 
      and Mayapan virus, were identified. Uxmal virus was isolated from three pools of 
      Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus and phylogenetic data indicate that it should
      be classified within the recently proposed taxon Negevirus. Mayapan virus was
      recovered from two pools of Psorophora ferox and is most closely related to
      unclassified Nodaviridae-like viruses. Two recognized viruses were also detected:
      Culex flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) and Houston virus (family Mesoniviridae), 
      with one and two isolates being recovered, respectively. The in vitro host ranges
      of all four viruses were determined by assessing their replicative abilities in
      cell lines of avian, human, monkey, hamster, murine, lepidopteran and mosquito
      (Aedes, Anopheles and Culex) origin, revealing that all viruses possess
      vertebrate replication-incompetent phenotypes. In conclusion, we report the
      isolation of both novel and recognized RNA viruses from mosquitoes collected in
      Mexico, and add to the growing plethora of viruses discovered recently through
      the use of metagenomics.

TI  - Detecting Associations Between Ciliated Protists and Prokaryotes with
      Culture-Independent Single-Cell Microbiomics: a Proof-of-Concept Study.
PG  - 232-242
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1279-9 [doi]
AB  - Symbioses between prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes, particularly ciliated
      protists, have been studied for a long time. Nevertheless, researchers have
      focused only on a few host genera and species, mainly due to difficulties in
      cultivating the hosts, and usually have considered a single symbiont at a time.
      Here, we present a pilot study using a single-cell microbiomic approach to
      circumvent these issues. Unicellular ciliate isolation followed by simultaneous
      amplification of eukaryotic and prokaryotic markers was used. Our preliminary
      test gave reliable and satisfactory results both on samples collected from
      different habitats (marine and freshwater) and on ciliates belonging to different
      taxonomic groups. Results suggest that, as already assessed for many
      macro-organisms like plants and metazoans, ciliated protists harbor distinct
      microbiomes. The applied approach detected new potential symbionts as well as new
      hosts for previously described ones, with relatively low time and cost effort and
      without culturing. When further developed, single-cell microbiomics for ciliates 
      could be applied to a large number of studies aiming to unravel the evolutionary 
      and ecological meaning of these symbiotic systems.

AB  - Consanguineous populations of the Arabian Peninsula have been underrepresented in
      global efforts that catalogue human exome variability. We sequenced 291 whole
      exomes of unrelated, healthy native Arab individuals from Kuwait to a median
      coverage of 45X and characterised 170,508 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), of
      which 21.7% were 'personal'. Up to 12% of the SNVs were novel and 36% were
      population-specific. Half of the SNVs were rare and 54% were missense variants.
      The study complemented the Greater Middle East Variome by way of reporting many
      additional Arabian exome variants. The study corroborated Kuwaiti population
      genetic substructures previously derived using genome-wide genotype data and
      illustrated the genetic relatedness among Kuwaiti population subgroups, Middle
      Eastern, European and Ashkenazi Jewish populations. The study mapped 112 rare and
      frequent functional variants relating to pharmacogenomics and disorders
      (recessive and common) to the phenotypic characteristics of Arab population.
      Comparative allele frequency data and carrier distributions of known Arab
      mutations for 23 disorders seen among Arabs, of putative OMIM-listed causal
      mutations for 12 disorders observed among Arabs but not yet characterized for
      genetic basis in Arabs, and of 17 additional putative mutations for disorders
      characterized for genetic basis in Arab populations are presented for testing in 
      future Arab studies.

TI  - Visualization-assisted binning of metagenome assemblies reveals potential new
      pathogenic profiles in idiopathic travelers' diarrhea.
PG  - 201
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0579-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is often caused by enterotoxigenic
      Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, other bacterial pathogens,
      Norovirus, and occasionally parasites. Nevertheless, standard diagnostic methods 
      fail to identify pathogens in more than 40% of TD patients. It is predicted that 
      new pathogens may be causative agents of the disease. RESULTS: We performed a
      comprehensive amplicon and whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic study of the
      fecal microbiomes from 23 TD patients and seven healthy travelers, all of which
      were negative for the known etiologic agents of TD based on standard
      microbiological and immunological assays. Abnormal and diverse taxonomic profiles
      in TD samples were revealed. WGS reads were assembled and the resulting contigs
      were visualized using multiple query types. A semi-manual workflow was applied to
      isolate independent genomes from metagenomic pools. A total of 565 genome bins
      were extracted, 320 of which were complete enough to be characterized as cellular
      genomes; 160 were viral genomes. We made predictions of the etiology of disease
      for many of the individual subjects based on the properties and features of the
      recovered genomes. Multiple patients with low-diversity metagenomes were
      predominated by one to several E. coli strains. Functional annotation allowed
      prediction of pathogenic type in many cases. Five patients were co-infected with 
      E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae, including Enterobacter,
      Klebsiella, and Citrobacter; these may represent blooms of organisms that appear 
      following secretory diarrhea. New "dark matter" microbes were observed in
      multiple samples. In one, we identified a novel TM7 genome that phylogenetically 
      clustered with a sludge isolate; it carries genes encoding potential virulence
      factors. In multiple samples, we observed high proportions of putative novel
      viral genomes, some of which form clusters with the ubiquitous gut virus,
      crAssphage. The total relative abundance of viruses was significantly higher in
      healthy travelers versus TD patients. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the
      strength of assembly-based metagenomics, especially the manually curated,
      visualization-assisted binning of contigs, in resolving unusual and
      under-characterized pathogenic profiles of human-associated microbiomes. Results 
      show that TD may be polymicrobial, with multiple novel cellular and viral strains
      as potential players in the diarrheal disease.

AB  - Phthalic acid esters (PAEs), such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and dibutyl
      phthalate (DBP), are widely distributed as environmental pollutants. In this
      study, the effects of these chemicals were investigated in black soils using a
      metagenomics approach. The results clearly showed that DMP or DBP increased the
      abundance of genes involved in transcription, replication and repair in black
      soils. In addition, the abundances of genes associated with metabolic functions
      was improved following treatment with DMP or DBP, including those involved in
      lipid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and energy
      production and conversion. There could be many reasons for these observed
      changes. First, the DMP or DBP treatments increased the abundances of genes
      associated with the LuxR family, the UvrABC repair system, DNA replication
      pathways, the RNA polymerase complex and base excision repair. Second, the
      abundances of genes associated with isocitrate lyase regulator (IclR) family
      transcriptional regulators, lipid metabolism and carbohydrate active enzymes
      (CAZys) were altered by the DMP or DBP treatments. Finally, the DMP or DBP
      treatments also increased the emission load of CO2 and altered the fluorescence
      intensity of humic acid. Therefore, the results of this study suggested that DMP 
      and DBP contamination altered the abundances of genes associated with genetic
      information processing and improved the carbon metabolism in black soils.

TI  - IMG/VR v.2.0: an integrated data management and analysis system for cultivated
      and environmental viral genomes.
PG  - D678-D686
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1127 [doi]
AB  - The Integrated Microbial Genome/Virus (IMG/VR) system v.2.0
      (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr/) is the largest publicly available data management
      and analysis platform dedicated to viral genomics. Since the last report
      published in the 2016, NAR Database Issue, the data has tripled in size and
      currently contains genomes of 8389 cultivated reference viruses, 12 498
      previously published curated prophages derived from cultivated microbial
      isolates, and 735 112 viral genomic fragments computationally predicted from
      assembled shotgun metagenomes. Nearly 60% of the viral genomes and genome
      fragments are clustered into 110 384 viral Operational Taxonomic Units (vOTUs)
      with two or more members. To improve data quality and predictions of host
      specificity, IMG/VR v.2.0 now separates prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses,
      utilizes known prophage sequences to improve taxonomic assignments, and provides 
      viral genome quality scores based on the estimated genome completeness. New
      features also include enhanced BLAST search capabilities for external queries.
      Finally, geographic map visualization to locate user-selected viral genomes or
      genome fragments has been implemented and download options have been extended.
      All of these features make IMG/VR v.2.0 a key resource for the study of viruses.

TI  - The Carbamate Aldicarb Altered the Gut Microbiome, Metabolome, and Lipidome of
      C57BL/6J Mice.
PG  - 67-79

AB  - The gut microbiome is highly involved in numerous aspects of host physiology,
      from energy harvest to stress response, and can confer many benefits to the host.
      The gut microbiome development could be affected by genetic and environmental
      factors, including pesticides. The carbamate insecticide aldicarb has been
      extensively used in agriculture, which raises serious public health concerns.
      However, the impact of aldicarb on the gut microbiome, host metabolome, and
      lipidome has not been well studied yet. Herein, we use multiomics approaches,
      including16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics sequencing, metabolomics, and 
      lipidomics, to elucidate aldicarb-induced toxicity in the gut microbiome and the 
      host metabolic homeostasis. We demonstrated that aldicarb perturbed the gut
      microbiome development trajectory, enhanced gut bacterial pathogenicity, altered 
      complex lipid profile, and induced oxidative stress, protein degradation, and DNA
      damage. The brain metabolism was also disturbed by the aldicarb exposure. These
      findings may provide a novel understanding of the toxicity of carbamate
      insecticides.

      Diagnostics for Viruses and Bacteria in Low Concentrated Surrogate and Clinical
      Samples.
PG  - 375
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2018.00375 [doi]
AB  - The etiologic cause of encephalitis, meningitis or meningo-encephalitis is
      unknown in up to 70% of cases. Clinical shotgun metagenomics combined with host
      depletion is a promising technique to identify infectious etiologies of central
      nervous system (CNS) infections. We developed a straightforward eukaryotic host
      nucleic acid depletion method that preserves intact viruses and bacteria for
      subsequent shotgun metagenomics screening of clinical samples, focusing on
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A surrogate CSF sample for a CNS infection paradigm
      was used to evaluate the proposed depletion method consisting of selective host
      cell lysis, followed by enzymatic degradation of the liberated genomic DNA for
      final depletion with paramagnetic beads. Extractives were subjected to reverse
      transcription, followed by whole genome amplification and next generation
      sequencing. The effectiveness of the host depletion method was demonstrated in
      surrogate CSF samples spiked with three 1:100 dilutions of Influenza A H3N2 virus
      (qPCR Ct-values 20.7, 28.8, >42/negative). Compared to the native samples, host
      depletion increased the amount of the virus subtype reads by factor 7127 and 132,
      respectively, while in the qPCR negative sample zero vs. 31 (1.4E-4 %) virus
      subtype reads were detected (native vs. depleted). The workflow was applied to
      thirteen CSF samples of patients with meningo-/encephalitis (two bacterial,
      eleven viral etiologies), a serum of an Andes virus infection and a nose swab of 
      a common cold patient. Unlike surrogate samples, host depletion of the thirteen
      human CSF samples and the nose swab did not result in more reads indicating
      presence of damaged pathogens due to, e.g., host immune response. Nevertheless,
      previously diagnosed pathogens in the human CSF samples (six viruses, two
      bacteria), the serum, and the nose swab (Human rhinovirus A31) were detected in
      the depleted and/or the native samples. Unbiased evaluation of the taxonomic
      profiles supported the diagnosed pathogen in two native CSF samples and the
      native and depleted serum and nose swab, while detecting various contaminations
      that interfered with pathogen identification at low concentration levels. In
      summary, damaged pathogens and contaminations complicated analysis and
      interpretation of clinical shotgun metagenomics data. Still, proper consideration
      of these issues may enable future application of metagenomics for clinical
      diagnostics.

AB  - We collected 8,700 mosquitoes in three sites in China, which belonged to seven
      species. Their viromes were tested using metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic
      analysis. The abundant viral sequences were detected and annotated belonging to
      more than 50 viral taxonomic families. The results were verified by PCR, followed
      by phylogenetic analysis. In the present study, we identified partial viral genes
      of dengue virus (DENV), a novel circovirus (CCV), densovirus (DNV), Japanese
      encephalitis virus (JEV), and Wuhan mosquito virus (WMV) in mosquitoes.
      Metagenomic analysis and PCR amplification revealed three DENV sequences, which
      were as homologous to the NS3 gene of DENV from Singapore isolated in 2005, with 
      at least 91% nucleotide (nt) identity. Seven fragments of JEV encoding structural
      proteins were identified belonging to genotype I. They all shared high homology
      with structural protein genes of JEV isolated from Laos in 2009. The production
      of infectious virus particles of the newly isolated virus YunnanJEV2017-4
      increased after passage from the BHK-21 cell line to the Vero cell line. Novel
      circovirus-related genes were identified and as being related to an unnamed gene 
      of a mosquito circovirus (MCCV) sequence from the USA isolated in 2011, with at
      least 41% nt identity: this distant relationship suggests that the parent virus
      might belong to a novel circovirus genus. Additionally, numerous known viruses
      and some unknown viruses were also detected in mosquitoes from Yunnan province,
      China, which will be tested for propagation.

      sequences, one of which encodes a partial envelope protein. Two ZIKV sequences
      both encoding partial nonstructural protein 3 and one JEV sequence encoding the
      complete envelope protein were identified. There was variability in the viral
      titers of the newly isolated virus JEV-China/YN2016-1 of different passage
      viruses. The newly identified Zika virus gene from ZIKV-China/YN2016-1 was an
      Asian genotype and shared the highest nucleotide sequence identity (97.1%) with a
      ZIKV sequence from Thailand isolated in 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of
      ZIKV-China/YN2016-1 and ZIKV-China/YN2016-2 with known Flavivirus genes indicated
      that ZIKV has propagated in Yunnan province, China.

PG  - e5882
LID - 10.7717/peerj.5882 [doi]
AB  - Accurate detection of target microbial species in metagenomic datasets from
      environmental samples remains limited because the limit of detection of current
      methods is typically inaccessible and the frequency of false-positives, resulting
      from inadequate identification of regions of the genome that are either too
      highly conserved to be diagnostic (e.g., rRNA genes) or prone to frequent
      horizontal genetic exchange (e.g., mobile elements) remains unknown. To overcome 
      these limitations, we introduce imGLAD, which aims to detect (target) genomic
      sequences in metagenomic datasets. imGLAD achieves high accuracy because it uses 
      the sequence-discrete population concept for discriminating between metagenomic
      reads originating from the target organism compared to reads from co-occurring
      close relatives, masks regions of the genome that are not informative using the
      MyTaxa engine, and models both the sequencing breadth and depth to determine
      relative abundance and limit of detection. We validated imGLAD by analyzing
      metagenomic datasets derived from spinach leaves inoculated with the enteric
      pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 and showed that its limit of detection can be
      comparable to that of PCR-based approaches for these samples ( approximately 1
      cell/gram).

PG  - 2564
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02564 [doi]
AB  - Analyses of intracellular NADPH concentrations are prerequisites for the design
      of microbial production strains and process optimization. mBFP was described as
      metagenomics derived, blue fluorescent protein showing NADPH-dependent
      fluorescence. Characterization of mBFP showed a high specificity for binding of
      NADPH (K D 0.64 mM) and no binding of NADH, the protein exclusively amplified
      fluorescence of NADPH. mBFP catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of
      benzaldehyde and further aldehydes, which fits to its classification as short
      chain dehydrogenase. For in vivo NADPH analyses a codon-optimized gene for mBFP
      was introduced into Corynebacterium glutamicum WT and the
      phosphoglucoisomerase-deficient strain C. glutamicum Deltapgi, which accumulates 
      high levels of NADPH. For determination of intracellular NADPH concentrations by 
      mBFP a calibration method with permeabilized cells was developed. By this means
      an increase of intracellular NADPH concentrations within seconds after the
      addition of glucose to nutrient-starved cells of both C. glutamicum WT and C.
      glutamicum Deltapgi was observed; as expected the internal NADPH concentration
      was significantly higher for C. glutamicum Deltapgi (0.31 mM) when compared to C.
      glutamicum WT (0.19 mM). Addition of paraquat to E. coli cells carrying mBFP led 
      as expected to an immediate decrease of intracellular NADPH concentrations,
      showing the versatile use of mBFP as intracellular sensor.

AB  - Food microbiome composition impacts food safety and quality. The resident
      microbiota of many food products is influenced throughout the farm to fork
      continuum by farming practices, environmental factors, and food manufacturing and
      processing procedures. Currently, most food microbiology studies rely on
      culture-dependent methods to identify bacteria. However, advances in
      high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the use of targeted 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing to profile complex microbial communities including
      non-culturable members. In this study we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess 
      the microbiome profiles of plant and animal derived foods collected at two points
      in the manufacturing process; post-harvest/pre-retail (cilantro) and retail
      (cilantro, masala spice mixes, cucumbers, mung bean sprouts, and smoked salmon). 
      Our findings revealed microbiome profiles, unique to each food, that were
      influenced by the moisture content (dry spices, fresh produce), packaging
      methods, such as modified atmospheric packaging (mung bean sprouts and smoked
      salmon), and manufacturing stage (cilantro prior to retail and at retail). The
      masala spice mixes and cucumbers were comprised mainly of Proteobacteria,
      Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Cilantro microbiome profiles consisted mainly of 
      Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes, and low levels of Firmicutes and
      Actinobacteria. The two brands of mung bean sprouts and the three smoked salmon
      samples differed from one another in their microbiome composition, each
      predominated by either by Firmicutes or Proteobacteria. These data demonstrate
      diverse and highly variable resident microbial communities across food products, 
      which is informative in the context of food safety, and spoilage where indigenous
      bacteria could hamper pathogen detection, and limit shelf life.

      Biodiversity in Biofilms.
PG  - 2520
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02520 [doi]
AB  - In drinking water distribution systems (DWDS), a disinfectant residual is usually
      applied to limit bacterial regrowth. However, delivering water with no or reduced
      chlorine residual could potentially decrease the selection for antimicrobial
      resistant microorganisms, favor bacterial regrowth and result in changes in
      bacterial populations. To evaluate the feasibility of water reduction in local
      DWDS while ensuring water safety, water quality was measured over 2 months in two
      different networks, each of them harboring sub-areas with normal and reduced
      chlorine. Water quality remained good in chlorine reduced samples, with limited
      development of total flora and absence of coliforms. Furthermore, 16S rRNA
      amplicon-based metagenomics was used to investigate the diversity and the
      composition of microbial communities in the sub-networks. Taxonomic
      classification of sequence reads showed a reduced bacterial diversity in sampling
      points with higher chlorine residuals. Chlorine disinfection created more
      homogeneous bacterial population, dominated by Pseudomonas, a genus that contains
      some major opportunistic pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. In the absence of
      chlorine, a larger and unknown biodiversity was unveiled, also highlighted by a
      decreased rate of taxonomic classification to the genus and species level.
      Overall, this experiment in a functional DWDS will facilitate the move toward
      potable water delivery systems without residual disinfectants and will improve
      water taste for consumers.

      Mice.
PG  - 2470
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02470 [doi]
AB  - Many risk factors related to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) have been proposed, including the most well-known of diabetes and obesity
      as well as periodontitis. As periodontal pathogenic bacteria produce endotoxins, 
      periodontal treatment can result in endotoxemia. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effects of intravenous, sonicated Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)
      injection on glucose/lipid metabolism, liver steatosis, and gut microbiota in
      mice. Endotoxemia was induced in C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) by intravenous
      injection of sonicated Pg; Pg was deactivated but its endotoxin remained. The
      mice were fed a high-fat diet and administered sonicated Pg (HFPg) or saline
      (HFco) injections for 12 weeks. Liver steatosis, glucose metabolism, and gene
      expression in the liver were evaluated. 16S rRNA gene sequencing with metagenome 
      prediction was performed on the gut microbiota. Compared to HFco mice, HFPg mice 
      exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance along with increased 
      liver steatosis. Liver microarray analysis demonstrated that 1278 genes were
      differentially expressed between HFco and HFPg mice. Gene set enrichment analysis
      showed that fatty acid metabolism, hypoxia, and TNFalpha signaling via NFkappaB
      gene sets were enriched in HFPg mice. Although sonicated Pg did not directly
      reach the gut, it changed the gut microbiota and decreased bacterial diversity in
      HFPg mice. Metagenome prediction in the gut microbiota showed enriched citrate
      cycle and carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes. Overall, intravenous injection
      of sonicated Pg caused impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and liver 
      steatosis in mice fed high-fat diets. Thus, blood infusion of Pg contributes to
      NAFLD and alters the gut microbiota.

TI  - Maternal High-Fat Diet Programs Offspring Liver Steatosis in a Sexually Dimorphic
      Manner in Association with Changes in Gut Microbial Ecology in Mice.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-34453-0 [doi]
AB  - The contributions of maternal diet and obesity in shaping offspring microbiome
      remain unclear. Here we employed a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity
      via high-fat diet feeding (HFD, 45% fat calories) for 12 wk prior to conception
      on offspring gut microbial ecology. Male and female offspring were provided
      access to control or HFD from weaning until 17 wk of age. Maternal HFD-associated
      programming was sexually dimorphic, with male offspring from HFD dams showing
      hyper-responsive weight gain to postnatal HFD. Likewise, microbiome analysis of
      offspring cecal contents showed differences in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity
      and higher Firmicutes in male compared to female mice. Weight gain in offspring
      was significantly associated with abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae
      families and Adlercreutzia, Coprococcus and Lactococcus genera. Sex differences
      in metagenomic pathways relating to lipid metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis and 
      immune response were also observed. HFD-fed male offspring from HFD dams also
      showed worse hepatic pathology, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, altered
      expression of bile acid regulators (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1 and Cyp39a1) and serum bile
      acid concentrations. These findings suggest that maternal HFD alters gut
      microbiota composition and weight gain of offspring in a sexually dimorphic
      manner, coincident with fatty liver and a pro-inflammatory state in male
      offspring.

AB  - The recent outbreak of Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) is one of the largest
      marine epizootics in history, but the host-associated microbial community changes
      specific to disease progression have not been characterized. Here, we sampled the
      microbiomes of ochre sea stars, Pisaster ochraceus, through time as animals
      stayed healthy or became sick and died with SSWD. We found community-wide
      differences in the microbiomes of sick and healthy sea stars, changes in
      microbial community composition through disease progression, and a decrease in
      species richness of the microbiome in late stages of SSWD. Known beneficial taxa 
      (Pseudoalteromonas spp.) decreased in abundance at symptom onset and through
      disease progression, while known pathogenic (Tenacibaculum spp.) and putatively
      opportunistic bacteria (Polaribacter spp. and Phaeobacter spp.) increased in
      abundance in early and late disease stages. Functional profiling revealed
      microbes more abundant in healthy animals performed functions that inhibit growth
      of other microbes, including pathogen detection, biosynthesis of secondary
      metabolites, and degradation of xenobiotics. Changes in microbial composition
      with disease onset and progression suggest that a microbial imbalance of the host
      could lead to SSWD or be a consequence of infection by another pathogen. This
      work highlights the importance of the microbiome in SSWD and also suggests that a
      healthy microbiome may help confer resistance to SSWD.

TI  - Identification of a 2'-O-Methyluridine Nucleoside Hydrolase Using the Metagenomic
      Libraries.
LID - E2904 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules23112904 [doi]
AB  - Ribose methylation is among the most ubiquitous modifications found in RNA.
      2'-O-methyluridine is found in rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and tRNA of Archaea, Bacteria,
      and Eukaryota. Moreover, 2'-O-methylribonucleosides are promising starting
      materials for the production of nucleic acid-based drugs. Despite the countless
      possibilities of practical use for the metabolic enzymes associated with
      methylated nucleosides, there are very few reports regarding the metabolic fate
      and enzymes involved in the metabolism of 2'-O-alkyl nucleosides. The presented
      work focuses on the cellular degradation of 2'-O-methyluridine. A novel enzyme
      was found using a screening strategy that employs Escherichia coli uracil
      auxotroph and the metagenomic libraries. A 2'-O-methyluridine hydrolase (RK9NH)
      has been identified together with an aldolase (RK9DPA)-forming a part of a
      probable gene cluster that is involved in the degradation of 2'-O-methylated
      nucleosides. The RK9NH is functional in E. coli uracil auxotroph and in vitro.
      The RK9NH nucleoside hydrolase could be engineered to enzymatically produce
      2'-O-methylated nucleosides that are of great demand as raw materials for
      production of nucleic acid-based drugs. Moreover, RK9NH nucleoside hydrolase
      converts 5-fluorouridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and
      5-fluoro-2'-O-methyluridine into 5-fluorouracil, which suggests it could be
      employed in cancer therapy.

TI  - Human Bacterial Repertoire of the Urinary Tract: a Potential Paradigm Shift.
LID - e00675-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00675-18 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this article is to review the human repertoire of bacteria in urine
      already described by culture and metagenomic techniques and published in the
      literature. Our study led us to compare this repertoire with other available
      human repertoires. We followed automatic and manual bibliographical methods and
      found 562 bacterial species reported in the literature as part of the human
      urinary microbiota. Of the 562 species, 322 were described only by culture, 101
      by both culture and metagenomics, and 139 only by metagenomics. A total of 352
      species (62.6%) have been associated with at least one case report of human
      infection, of which 225 (40.0%) have been described as causative agents of
      urinary tract infection. The urinary tract bacterial repertoire contains 21.4% of
      the known prokaryotic diversity associated with human beings (464 species in
      common), and it shares 23.6% species with the human gut microbiota (350 species
      in common, 62.3% of the urine species). The urinary repertoire shares a
      significant difference in aerointolerant species compared with those of the gut
      microbiota (100/562 [17.8%] and 505/1,484 [34.0%], respectively; P < 0.001; odds 
      ratio [OR] = 9.0 [7.0 to 11.4]). Studies using high-throughput sequencing show a 
      higher proportion of aerointolerant bacteria in urine (74/240 [30.8%]) than
      studies using culture techniques (40/423 [9.5%]). Most pathogenic bacteria are
      part of the commensal human urinary tract bacteria, and their pathogenicity may
      occur following any imbalance of this microbiota. The restoration of urinary
      tract health can occur following a fecal transplantation. The potential gut
      origin of the human bacterial microbiota has to be explored.

TI  - Extensive Diversity of RNA Viruses in Australian Ticks.
LID - e01358-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01358-18 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the microbiome of ticks in Australia is of considerable interest
      given the ongoing debate over whether Lyme disease and its causative agent, the
      bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, are present in Australia. The
      diversity of bacteria infecting Australian ticks has been studied using both
      culture- and metagenomics-based techniques. However, little is known about the
      virome of Australian ticks, including whether this includes viruses with the
      potential to infect mammals. We used a meta-transcriptomics approach to reveal
      the diversity and evolution of viruses from Australian ticks collected from two
      locations on the central east coast of Australia, including metropolitan Sydney. 
      From this we identified 19 novel RNA viruses belonging to 12 families, as well as
      1 previously described RNA virus. The majority of these viruses were related to
      arthropod-associated viruses, suggesting that they do not utilize mammalian
      hosts. However, two novel viruses discovered in ticks feeding on bandicoot
      marsupials clustered closely within the mammal-associated hepacivirus and
      pestivirus groups (family Flaviviridae). Another bandicoot tick yielded a novel
      coltivirus (family Reoviridae), a group of largely tick-associated viruses
      containing the known human pathogen Colorado tick fever virus and its relative,
      Eyach virus. Importantly, our transcriptomic data provided no evidence for the
      presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in any tick sample, providing further
      evidence against the presence of Lyme disease in Australia. In sum, this study
      reveals that Australian ticks harbor a diverse virome, including some viruses
      that merit additional screening in the context of emerging infectious
      disease.IMPORTANCE Each year a growing number of individuals along the east coast
      of Australia experience debilitating disease following tick bites. As there is no
      evidence for the presence of the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia b
      urgdorferi sensu lato, in Australian ticks, the etiological basis of this disease
      syndrome remains controversial. To characterize the viruses associated with
      Australian ticks, particularly those that might be associated with mammalian
      infection, we performed unbiased RNA sequencing on 146 ticks collected across two
      locations along the coast of New South Wales, Australia. This revealed 19 novel
      RNA viruses from a diverse set of families. Notably, three of these viruses
      clustered with known mammalian viruses, including a novel coltivirus that was
      related to the human pathogen Colorado tick fever virus.

AB  - Objective To investigate the associations of socioeconomic factors,nutrients
      intake,and gut microbiota of healthy pregnant women in the third trimester with
      gestational weight gain (GWG).Methods We recruited 98 pregnant women in the third
      trimester who had received antenatal care in the Department of Obstetrics
      Gynecology,Peking Union Medical College Hospital from October,2015 to May,2016.
      We collected socioeconomic information through a structured questionnaire
      covering age,ethnicity,height,pre-pregnancy weight,and education. Nutritional
      status of these pregnant women was assessed by a 24-hour dietary intake recall.
      The participants were provided with collective tubes for faecal sample collection
      at home;their weight before the delivery was recorded. The pre-pregnancy weight
      and GWG were classified according to World Health Organization body mass index
      (BMI) standard for adults and the Institute of Medicine GWG guidelines
      (2009),respectively. The gut microbiota of the participants were analyzed using a
      whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing method.Results Insufficient and excessive GWG
      accounted for 15.3% and 50.0% of the cohort,respectively. Appropriate GWG level
      was associated with intakes of fat (F=3.113,P=0.049),carbohydrates
      (F=3.750,P=0.027),and dietary fiber (F=4.499,P=0.014) but not with age
      (F=2.495,P=0.088),ethnicity (Chi (2)=0.065,P=0.968),education (Chi
      (2)=0.827,P=0.661),or pre-pregnancy BMI (F=0.121,P=0.887). Compared with the
      participants with appropriate GWG,those with excessive GWG had significantly
      higher abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila,Atopobium parvulum,and Alistipes
      indistinctus as well as lower abundance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus,Weissella
      unclassified,Eubacterium ventriosum,Ruminococcus torques,and Bacteroides
      uniformis. Compared with the participants with appropriate GWG,those with
      insufficient GWG had significantly higher abundance of Dialister
      invisus,Alistipes unclassified,Peptoniphilus harei,Escherichia
      unclassified,Parvimonas unclassified,Campylobacter ureolyticus,Lactobacillus
      crispatus,and Fusobacterium nucleatum and lower abundance of Eubacterium
      ventriosum.Conclusions Abnormal GWG is common in pregnant women. GWG is
      significantly associated with gut microbiota as well as with nutritional factors 
      including fat,carbohydrate,and dietary fiber intake.

AB  - Shotgun metagenomics sequencing is a powerful tool for the characterization of
      complex biological matrices, enabling analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
      organisms and viruses in a single experiment, with the possibility of
      reconstructing de novo the whole metagenome or a set of genes of interest. One of
      the main factors limiting the use of shotgun metagenomics on wide scale projects 
      is the high cost associated with the approach. We set out to determine if it is
      possible to use shallow shotgun metagenomics to characterize complex biological
      matrices while reducing costs. We used a staggered mock community to estimate the
      optimal threshold for species detection. We measured the variation of several
      summary statistics simulating a decrease in sequencing depth by randomly
      subsampling a number of reads. The main statistics that were compared are
      diversity estimates, species abundance, and ability of reconstructing de novo the
      metagenome in terms of length and completeness. Our results show that diversity
      indices of complex prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral communities can be
      accurately estimated with 500,000 reads or less, although particularly complex
      samples may require 1,000,000 reads. On the contrary, any task involving the
      reconstruction of the metagenome performed poorly, even with the largest
      simulated subsample (1,000,000 reads). The length of the reconstructed assembly
      was smaller than the length obtained with the full dataset, and the proportion of
      conserved genes that were identified in the meta-genome was drastically reduced
      compared to the full sample. Shallow shotgun metagenomics can be a useful tool to
      describe the structure of complex matrices, but it is not adequate to
      reconstruct-even partially-the metagenome.

AB  - An important question in microbiology is whether treatment causes changes in gut 
      flora, and whether it also affects metabolism. The reconstruction of causal
      relations purely from non-temporal observational data is challenging. We address 
      the problem of causal inference in a bivariate case, where the joint distribution
      of two variables is observed. We consider, in particular, data on discrete
      domains. The state-of-the-art causal inference methods for continuous data suffer
      from high computational complexity. Some modern approaches are not suitable for
      categorical data, and others need to estimate and fix multiple hyper-parameters. 
      In this contribution, we introduce a novel method of causal inference which is
      based on the widely used assumption that if X causes Y, then P(X) and P(Y|X) are 
      independent. We propose to explore a semi-supervised approach where P(Y|X) and
      P(X) are estimated from labeled and unlabeled data respectively, whereas the
      marginal probability is estimated potentially from much more (cheap unlabeled)
      data than the conditional distribution. We validate the proposed method on the
      standard cause-effect pairs. We illustrate by experiments on several benchmarks
      of biological network reconstruction that the proposed approach is very
      competitive in terms of computational time and accuracy compared to the
      state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we apply the proposed method to an original
      medical task where we study whether drugs confound human metagenome.

LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2879342 [doi]
AB  - The importance of the composition and signature of rumen microbial communities
      has gained increasing attention. One of the key techniques was to infer
      co-abundance networks through correlation analysis based on relative abundances. 
      While substantial insights and progress have been made, it has been found that
      due to the compositional nature of data, correlation analysis derived from
      relative abundance could produce misleading results and spurious associations. In
      this study, we proposed the use of a framework including a compendium of two
      correlation measures and three dissimilarity metrics in an attempt to mitigate
      the compositional effect in the inference of significant associations in the
      bovine rumen microbiome. We tested the framework on rumen microbiome data
      including both 16S rRNA and KEGG genes associated with methane production in
      cattle. Based on the identification of significant positive and negative
      associations supported by multiple metrics, two co-occurrence networks, e.g.,
      co-presence and mutual-exclusion networks, were constructed. Significant modules 
      associated with methane emissions were identified. In comparison to previous
      studies, our analysis demonstrates that deriving microbial associations based on 
      the correlations between relative abundances may not only lead to missing
      information but also produce spurious associations. To bridge together different 
      co-presence and mutual-exclusion relations, a multiplex network model has been
      proposed for integrative analysis of co-occurrence networks which has great
      potential to support the prediction of animal phytotypes and to provide
      additional insights into biological mechanisms of the microbiome associated with 
      the traits.

      and Candida albicans.

LID - 10.1128/mBio.02032-18 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota confers resistance to pathogens of the intestinal ecosystem,
      yet the dynamics of pathogen-microbiome interactions and the metabolites involved
      in this process remain largely unknown. Here, we use gnotobiotic mice infected
      with the virulent pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or the
      opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans in combination with metagenomics and
      discovery metabolomics to identify changes in the community and metabolome during
      infection. To isolate the role of the microbiota in response to pathogens, we
      compared mice monocolonized with the pathogen, uninfected mice "humanized" with a
      synthetic human microbiome, or infected humanized mice. In Salmonella-infected
      mice, by 3 days into infection, microbiome community structure and function
      changed substantially, with a rise in Enterobacteriaceae strains and a reduction 
      in biosynthetic gene cluster potential. In contrast, Candida-infected mice had
      few microbiome changes. The LC-MS metabolomic fingerprint of the cecum differed
      between mice monocolonized with either pathogen and humanized infected mice.
      Specifically, we identified an increase in glutathione disulfide, glutathione
      cysteine disulfide, inosine 5'-monophosphate, and hydroxybutyrylcarnitine in mice
      infected with Salmonella in contrast to uninfected mice and mice monocolonized
      with Salmonella These metabolites potentially play a role in pathogen-induced
      oxidative stress. These results provide insight into how the microbiota community
      members interact with each other and with pathogens on a metabolic
      level.IMPORTANCE The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized for playing a
      critical role in human health and disease, especially in conferring resistance to
      both virulent pathogens such as Salmonella, which infects 1.2 million people in
      the United States every year (E. Scallan, R. M. Hoekstra, F. J. Angulo, R. V.
      Tauxe, et al., Emerg Infect Dis 17:7-15, 2011,
      https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1701.P11101), and opportunistic pathogens like
      Candida, which causes an estimated 46,000 cases of invasive candidiasis each year
      in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Antibiotic
      Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013, 2013). Using a gnotobiotic mouse
      model, we investigate potential changes in gut microbial community structure and 
      function during infection using metagenomics and metabolomics. We observe that
      changes in the community and in biosynthetic gene cluster potential occur within 
      3 days for the virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, but there are
      minimal changes with a poorly colonizing Candida albicans In addition, the
      metabolome shifts depending on infection status, including changes in glutathione
      metabolites in response to Salmonella infection, potentially in response to host

TI  - Members of the Genus Methylobacter Are Inferred To Account for the Majority of
      Aerobic Methane Oxidation in Oxic Soils from a Freshwater Wetland.

AB  - Microbial carbon degradation and methanogenesis in wetland soils generate a large
      proportion of atmospheric methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Despite their 
      potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, knowledge about methane-consuming
      methanotrophs is often limited to lower-resolution single-gene surveys that fail 
      to capture the taxonomic and metabolic diversity of these microorganisms in
      soils. Here our objective was to use genome-enabled approaches to investigate
      methanotroph membership, distribution, and in situ activity across spatial and
      seasonal gradients in a freshwater wetland near Lake Erie. 16S rRNA gene analyses
      demonstrated that members of the methanotrophic Methylococcales were dominant,
      with the dominance largely driven by the relative abundance of four taxa, and
      enriched in oxic surface soils. Three methanotroph genomes from assembled soil
      metagenomes were assigned to the genus Methylobacter and represented the most
      abundant methanotrophs across the wetland. Paired metatranscriptomes confirmed
      that these Old Woman Creek (OWC) Methylobacter members accounted for nearly all
      the aerobic methanotrophic activity across two seasons. In addition to having the
      capacity to couple methane oxidation to aerobic respiration, these new genomes
      encoded denitrification potential that may sustain energy generation in soils
      with lower dissolved oxygen concentrations. We further show that Methylobacter
      members that were closely related to the OWC members were present in many other
      high-methane-emitting freshwater and soil sites, suggesting that this lineage
      could participate in methane consumption in analogous ecosystems. This work
      contributes to the growing body of research suggesting that Methylobacter may
      represent critical mediators of methane fluxes in freshwater saturated sediments 
      and soils worldwide.IMPORTANCE Here we used soil metagenomics and
      metatranscriptomics to uncover novel members within the genus Methylobacter We
      denote these closely related genomes as members of the lineage OWC Methylobacter 
      Despite the incredibly high microbial diversity in soils, here we present
      findings that unexpectedly showed that methane cycling was primarily mediated by 
      a single genus for both methane production ("Candidatus Methanothrix paradoxum") 
      and methane consumption (OWC Methylobacter). Metatranscriptomic analyses revealed
      that decreased methanotrophic activity rather than increased methanogenic
      activity possibly contributed to the greater methane emissions that we had
      previously observed in summer months, findings important for biogeochemical
      methane models. Although members of this Methylococcales order have been
      cultivated for decades, multi-omic approaches continue to illuminate the
      methanotroph phylogenetic and metabolic diversity harbored in terrestrial and
      marine ecosystems.

PG  - 799
LID - 10.1186/s12864-018-5160-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Count data derived from high-throughput deoxy-ribonucliec acid (DNA) 
      sequencing is frequently used in quantitative molecular assays. Due to properties
      inherent to the sequencing process, unnormalized count data is compositional,
      measuring relative and not absolute abundances of the assayed features. This
      compositional bias confounds inference of absolute abundances. Commonly used
      count data normalization approaches like library size
      scaling/rarefaction/subsampling cannot correct for compositional or any other
      relevant technical bias that is uncorrelated with library size. RESULTS: We
      demonstrate that existing techniques for estimating compositional bias fail with 
      sparse metagenomic 16S count data and propose an empirical Bayes normalization
      approach to overcome this problem. In addition, we clarify the assumptions
      underlying frequently used scaling normalization methods in light of
      compositional bias, including scaling methods that were not designed directly to 
      address it. CONCLUSIONS: Compositional bias, induced by the sequencing machine,
      confounds inferences of absolute abundances. We present a normalization technique
      for compositional bias correction in sparse sequencing count data, and
      demonstrate its improved performance in metagenomic 16s survey data. Based on the
      distribution of technical bias estimates arising from several publicly available 
      large scale 16s count datasets, we argue that detailed experiments specifically
      addressing the influence of compositional bias in metagenomics are needed.

TI  - An improved environmental DNA assay for bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) based
      on the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer I.
PG  - e0206851
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0206851 [doi]
AB  - The majority of environmental DNA (eDNA) assays for vertebrate species are based 
      on commonly analyzed regions of the mitochondrial genome. However, the high
      degree of mitochondrial similarity between two species of charr (Salvelinus
      spp.), southern Dolly Varden (S. malma lordii) and bull trout (Salvelinus
      confluentus), precludes the development of a mitochondrial eDNA assay to
      distinguish them. Presented here is an eDNA assay to detect bull trout based on
      the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITSI), a nuclear marker. This
      assay successfully detects bull trout and avoids detecting Dolly Varden as well
      as brook trout (S. fontinalis), Arctic char (S. alpinus), and lake trout (S.
      namaycush). In addition, this assay was compared with an extensively used
      mitochondrial bull trout assay and it was found that the ITSI-based assay
      produced higher detectability. Our results suggest this assay should out-perform 
      the published mtDNA assay across the range of bull trout, while the added
      specificity allows reliable bull trout detection in areas where bull trout
      co-occur with other charr such as Dolly Varden. While clearly a superior assay in
      this instance, basing assays on ITSI is not without problems. For vertebrates,
      there are fewer ITSI sequences available than commonly sequenced regions of the
      mitochondrial genome. Thus, the initial in silico screening of candidate assays
      must be preceded by much more extensive sampling and sequencing of sympatric or
      closely related taxa. Further, all copies of the internal transcribed spacers
      within an individual may not be identical, which can lead to complications.
      Lastly, the copy number for ITSI varies widely across taxa; the greater
      detectability associated with this assay cannot be assumed for other species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are communicable diseases caused
      by a group of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths prevalent in more than
      145 countries that affect the world's poverty stricken populations. WHO enlists
      18 NTDs amongst people living in endemic areas having inaccessibility to
      preventive measures. Steps to reduce the global disease burden of the NTDs need
      attention at multi-factorial levels. Control programmes, mass drug
      administrations, transmission checks, eradication surveillances and diagnoses are
      some of them. The foremost in this list is confirmatory diagnosis. A
      comprehensive summary of the innovative, high-impact, multiplexed, low-cost
      diagnostic tools developed in the last decade that helped to meet the needs of
      users can depict a holistic approach to further evaluate potential technologies
      and reagents currently in research. Major Advancements: A literature survey based
      on developing nano-biotechnological platforms to meet the diagnostic challenges
      in NTDs towards development of a useful point-of-care (POC) unit is reported.
      However, in order to pave the way for complete eradication more sensitive tools
      are required that are user-friendly and applicable for use in endemic and
      low-resource settings. There are various novel research progresses/advancements
      made for qualitative and quantitative measurement of infectious load in some
      diseases like dengue, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis; though further
      improvements on the specificity and sensitivity front are still awaited.
      Strategies to combat the problem of antimicrobial drug resistance in diagnosis of
      NTDs have also been put forward by various research groups and organizations.
      Moreover, the state-of-the-art "omics" approaches like metabolomics and
      metagenomics have also started to contribute constructively towards diagnosis and
      prevention of the NTDs. CONCLUSION: A concrete solution towards a single specimen
      based common biomarker detection platform for NTDs is lacking. Identifying robust
      biomarkers and implementing them on simple diagnostic tools to ease the process
      of pathogen detection can help us understand the obstacles in current diagnostic 
      measures of the NTDs.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Targeted therapy is the foundation of personalized medicine in
      cancer, which is often understood as the right patient using the right drug.
      Thinking from the viewpoint of determinants during personalized drug treatment,
      the genetics, epigenetics and metagenomics would provide individual-specific
      biological elements to characterize the personalized responses for therapy.
      METHODS: Such personalized determinants should be not only understood as specific
      to one person, while they should have certain replicate observations in a group
      of individuals but not all, which actually provide more credible and reproducible
      personalized biological features. The requirement of detecting personalized
      determinants is well supported by novel high-throughput sequencing technologies
      and newly temporal-spatial experimental protocols, which quickly produce the
      omics big data. RESULTS: In this mini-review, we would like to give a brief
      introduction firstly on the advanced drug or drug-like therapy with genetics,
      epigenetics and metagenomics, respectively, from the viewpoint of personalized
      determinants; then summarize the computational methods helpful to analyze the
      corresponding omics data under the consideration of personalized biological
      context; and particularly focus on metagenomics to discuss current data, method, 
      and opportunity for personalized medicine. CONCLUSION: Totally, detecting
      personalized determinants during drug treatment from omics big data will bring
      the precision medicine or personalized medicine from concept to application. More
      and more inspiring biotechnologies, data resources, and analytic approaches will 
      benefit All of US in the near future.

TI  - Diversity and Coding Potential of the Microbiota in the Photic and Aphotic Zones 
      of Tropical Man-Made Lake with Intensive Aquaculture Activities: a Case Study on 
      Temengor Lake, Malaysia.
PG  - 20-32
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1283-0 [doi]
AB  - Although freshwater biomes cover less than 1% of the Earth's surface, they have
      disproportionate ecological significances. Attempts to study the taxonomy and
      function of freshwater microbiota are currently limited to samples collected from
      temperate lakes. In this study, we investigated samples from the photic and
      aphotic of an aquaculture site (disturbed) of Temengor Lake, a tropical lake in
      comparison with the undisturbed site of the lake using 16S rRNA amplicon and
      shotgun metagenomic approaches. Vertical changes in bacterial community
      composition and function of the Temengor Lake metagenomes were observed. The
      photic water layer of Temengor Lake was dominated by typical freshwater
      assemblages consisting of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
      Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria lineages. On the other hand, the aphotic water
      featured in addition to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and two
      more abundant bacterial phyla that are typically ubiquitous in anoxic habitats
      (Chloroflexi and Firmicutes). The aphotic zone of Temengor Lake exhibited genetic
      potential for nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms for which terminal electron
      acceptors other than oxygen are used in the reactions. The aphotic water of the
      disturbed site also showed an overrepresentation of genes associated with the
      metabolism of carbohydrates, likely driven by the enrichment of nutrient
      resulting from aquaculture activities at the site. The results presented in this 
      study can serve as a basis for understanding the structure and functional
      capacity of the microbial communities in the photic and aphotic zones/water
      layers of tropical man-made lakes.

TI  - Microbiome analysis of Pacific white shrimp gut and rearing water from Malaysia
      and Vietnam: implications for aquaculture research and management.
PG  - e5826
LID - 10.7717/peerj.5826 [doi]
AB  - Aquaculture production of the Pacific white shrimp is the largest in the world
      for crustacean species. Crucial to the sustainable global production of this
      important seafood species is a fundamental understanding of the shrimp gut
      microbiota and its relationship to the microbial ecology of shrimp pond. This is 
      especially true, given the recently recognized role of beneficial microbes in
      promoting shrimp nutrient intake and in conferring resistance against pathogens. 
      Unfortunately, aquaculture-related microbiome studies are scarce in Southeast
      Asia countries despite the severe impact of early mortality syndrome outbreaks on
      shrimp production in the region. In this study, we employed the 16S rRNA amplicon
      (V3-V4 region) sequencing and amplicon sequence variants (ASV) method to
      investigate the microbial diversity of shrimp guts and pond water samples
      collected from aquaculture farms located in Malaysia and Vietnam. Substantial
      differences in the pond microbiota were observed between countries with the
      presence and absence of several taxa extending to the family level. Microbial
      diversity of the shrimp gut was found to be generally lower than that of the pond
      environments with a few ubiquitous genera representing a majority of the shrimp
      gut microbial diversity such as Vibrio and Photobacterium, indicating
      host-specific selection of microbial species. Given the high sequence
      conservation of the 16S rRNA gene, we assessed its veracity at distinguishing
      Vibrio species based on nucleotide alignment against type strain reference
      sequences and demonstrated the utility of ASV approach in uncovering a wider
      diversity of Vibrio species compared to the conventional OTU clustering approach.

TI  - Expanded skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients.
PG  - 1815-1821
LID - 10.1038/s41591-018-0211-7 [doi]
AB  - Human microbiome studies have revealed the intricate interplay of host immunity
      and bacterial communities to achieve homeostatic balance. Healthy skin microbial 
      communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation(1-3), mainly 
      bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common
      and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited.
      Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding
      of microbial-host interactions. Primary immunodeficient patients manifest with
      various viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, including skin
      infections(4). Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary
      human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic
      infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility(5). DOCK8, encoding a
      guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates
      actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense
      tissues such as skin(6). Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from
      DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral 
      representation and diversity compared with healthy volunteers. De novo assembly
      approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes,
      illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in
      DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in
      controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection.

TI  - Gut microbiota and intestinal FXR mediate the clinical benefits of metformin.
PG  - 1919-1929
LID - 10.1038/s41591-018-0222-4 [doi]
AB  - The anti-hyperglycemic effect of metformin is believed to be caused by its direct
      action on signaling processes in hepatocytes, leading to lower hepatic
      gluconeogenesis. Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota
      community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the
      drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However,
      the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with
      the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed
      metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which
      revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile acid
      glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were
      accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We 
      further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were
      predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of
      metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further
      identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic
      endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts
      in part through a B. fragilis-GUDCA-intestinal FXR axis to improve metabolic
      dysfunction, including hyperglycemia.

AB  - Small bacterial and archaeal genomes provide insights into the minimal
      requirements for life(1) and are phylogenetically widespread(2). However, the
      precise environmental pressures that constrain genome size in free-living
      microorganisms are unknown. A study including isolates has shown that
      thermophiles and other bacteria with high optimum growth temperatures often have 
      small genomes(3). It is unclear whether this relationship extends generally to
      microorganisms in nature(4,5) and more specifically to microorganisms that
      inhabit complex and highly variable environments, such as soils(3,6,7). To
      understand the genomic traits of thermally adapted microorganisms, here we
      investigated metagenomes from a 45 degrees C gradient of temperate-to-thermal
      soils that lie over the ongoing Centralia, Pennsylvania (USA) coal-seam fire. We 
      found that hot soils harboured distinct communities with small genomes and small 
      cell sizes relative to those in ambient soils. Hot soils notably lacked genes
      that encode known two-component regulatory systems, and antimicrobial production 
      and resistance genes. Our results provide field evidence for the inverse
      relationship between microbial genome size and temperature in a diverse,
      free-living community over a wide range of temperatures that support microbial
      life.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites spread worldwide and are well known as vectors of many
      viruses of great importance to human and animal health. However, the viral
      diversity in ticks is still poorly understood, particularly in South America.
      Here we characterized the viral diversity present in Rhipicephalus microplus
      parasitizing cattle in the southern region of Brazil using metagenomics. Our
      study revealed the presence of viruses that had not been previously described in 
      the region, including lihan tick virus (Phenuiviridae family) and wuhan tick
      virus 2 (Chuviridae family), as well as expands the biogeography of jingmen tick 
      virus (Flaviviridae family) in Brazil. Also, we described three novel tymoviruses
      (Tymovirales order), named guarapuava tymovirus-like 1 to 3. We described the
      genomic and phylogenetic characterization of these viruses. Our study sheds light
      on the viral diversity of Rhipicephalus microplus in South America, and also
      expands the biogeography of tick viruses that were previously described only in
      Asia.

TI  - Current progress and future opportunities in applications of bioinformatics for

AB  - The Mid-Atlantic Microbiome Meet-up (M(3)) organization brings together academic,
      government, and industry groups to share ideas and develop best practices for
      microbiome research. In January of 2018, M(3) held its fourth meeting, which
      focused on recent advances in biodefense, specifically those relating to
      infectious disease, and the use of metagenomic methods for pathogen detection.
      Presentations highlighted the utility of next-generation sequencing technologies 
      for identifying and tracking microbial community members across space and time.
      However, they also stressed the current limitations of genomic approaches for
      biodefense, including insufficient sensitivity to detect low-abundance pathogens 
      and the inability to quantify viable organisms. Participants discussed ways in
      which the community can improve software usability and shared new computational
      tools for metagenomic processing, assembly, annotation, and visualization.
      Looking to the future, they identified the need for better bioinformatics
      toolkits for longitudinal analyses, improved sample processing approaches for
      characterizing viruses and fungi, and more consistent maintenance of database
      resources. Finally, they addressed the necessity of improving data standards to
      incentivize data sharing. Here, we summarize the presentations and discussions
      from the meeting, identifying the areas where microbiome analyses have improved
      our ability to detect and manage biological threats and infectious disease, as
      well as gaps of knowledge in the field that require future funding and focus.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome is a complex disease that is exponentially increasing in the
      western world, and diet is one of the possible ways to improve the metabolic
      status of patients. Barley beta glucans are dietary fibres that show promise for 
      improvement cholesterol levels and postprandial glucose response, but they have
      been rarely investigated in human trials with concurrent focus on gut microbiota.
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial was conducted with 
      43 volunteers with high risk for metabolic syndrome development or with diagnosed
      metabolic syndrome. During a four-week intervention study, participants consumed 
      experimental bread containing 6g of barley beta glucans or equal bread but
      without beta glucans. After dietary intervention, total plasma cholesterol
      decreased in the test group (-0.26+/-0.54, p=0.019), but not in the control
      group. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) composition in faeces significantly changed
      with increase of propionic acid in test group (43.2%, p=0.045) and with decrease 
      of acetic acid in control group (41.8%, p=0.011). The microbiome analysis based
      on Illumina paired end sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed a decrease in
      microbial diversity and richness in the test group. The pre-intervention gut
      microbiota composition showed higher abundance of health associated
      Bifidobacterium spp. and Akkermansia municiphila within cholesterol-responsive
      group, showing that diet-induced metabolic response is possibly dependent on
      individual gut microbiota composition.

AB  - Rapid pathogen identification during an acute febrile illness is a critical first
      step for providing appropriate clinical care and patient isolation. Primary
      screening using sensitive and specific assays, such as real-time PCR and ELISAs, 
      can rapidly test for known circulating infectious diseases. If the initial
      testing is negative, potentially due to a lack of developed diagnostic assays or 
      an incomplete understanding of the pathogens circulating within a geographic
      region, additional testing would be required including highly multiplexed assays 
      and metagenomic next generation sequencing. To bridge the gap between rapid point
      of care diagnostics and sequencing, we developed a highly multiplexed assay
      designed to detect 164 different viruses, bacteria, and parasites using the
      NanoString nCounter platform. Included in this assay were high consequence
      pathogens such as Ebola virus, highly endemic organisms including several
      Plasmodium species, and a large number of less prevalent pathogens to ensure a
      broad coverage of potential human pathogens. Evaluation of this panel resulted in
      positive detection of 113 (encompassing 98 different human pathogen types) of the
      126 organisms available to us including the medically important Ebola virus,
      Lassa virus, dengue virus serotypes 1-4, Chikungunya virus, yellow fever virus,
      and Plasmodium falciparum. Overall, this assay could improve infectious disease
      diagnostics and biosurveillance efforts as a quick, highly multiplexed, and easy 
      to use pathogen screening tool.

AB  - About 60% of natural gas production in the United States comes from hydraulic
      fracturing of unconventional reservoirs, such as shales or organic-rich micrites.
      This process inoculates and enriches for halotolerant microorganisms in these
      reservoirs over time, resulting in a saline ecosystem that includes methane
      producing archaea. Here, we survey the biogeography of methanogens across
      unconventional reservoirs, and report that members of genus Methanohalophilus are
      recovered from every hydraulically fractured unconventional reservoir sampled by 
      metagenomics. We provide the first genomic sequencing of three isolate genomes,
      as well as two metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Utilizing six other
      previously sequenced isolate genomes and MAGs, we perform comparative analysis of
      the 11 genomes representing this genus. This genomic investigation revealed
      distinctions between surface and subsurface derived genomes that are consistent
      with constraints encountered in each environment. Genotypic differences were also
      uncovered between isolate genomes recovered from the same well, suggesting niche 
      partitioning among closely related strains. These genomic substrate utilization
      predictions were then confirmed by physiological investigation. Fine-scale
      microdiversity was observed in CRISPR-Cas systems of Methanohalophilus, with
      genomes from geographically distinct unconventional reservoirs sharing spacers
      targeting the same viral population. These findings have implications for
      augmentation strategies resulting in enhanced biogenic methane production in
      hydraulically fractured unconventional reservoirs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1% of children and has no
      cure. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are common in children with ASD, and
      although gut microbiota is known to play an important role in ASD through the
      gut-brain axis, the specific mechanism is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that 
      gut microbiota may participate in the pathogenesis of ASD through immune- and
      inflammation-mediated pathways. Here, we identified potentially immunogenic
      epitopes derived from gut microbiota in stool samples from ASD children with and 
      without GI problems and typically developing (TD) children. METHODS: Candidate
      gut microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were identified by blast shotgun
      metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from 43 ASD children (19 with and 24
      without GI involvement) and 31 sex- and age-matched typically developing (TD)
      children. Potentially immunogenic epitopes were screened against a predictive
      human Immune Epitope Database. The composition and abundance of candidate MEs
      were compared between the three groups of children. RESULTS: MEs identified in
      ASD children with GI problems were significantly more diverse than those in TD
      children. ME composition could discriminate between the three groups of children.
      We identified 34 MEs that were significantly more or less abundant in ASD
      children than TD children, most (29/34) of the differences in MEs were reduced in
      ASD and associated with abnormal gut IgA level and altered gut microbiota
      composition, these MEs were limited effected by clinical factors such as age,
      gender, and GI problems, of which eleven MEs were pathogenic microorganisms
      peptides with strong T or B cell response, nine MEs showed high homology to
      peptides from human self proteins associated with autoimmune disease occurrence, 
      eliciting immune attack against hematopoietic stem cells and inhibition antigen
      binding. We also found that the abundance of five MEs were increased in ASD,
      including three human self proteins, gap junction alpha-1 (GJA1), paired box
      protein Pax-3 (PAX3) and eyes absent homolog 1 isoform 4 (EYA1) which associated 
      with cancer, and a ME with homology to a Listeriolysin O peptide from the
      pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes was significantly increased in ASD
      children compared with TD children. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the
      abnormal of MEs composition in the gut of children with ASD, moreover, the
      abnormality in MEs composition was associated with abnormal gut IgA levels and
      altered gut microbiota composition, this abnormality also suggests that there may
      be abnormalities in intestinal immunity in children with ASD; In all, thirty-four
      MEs identified were potential biomarker of ASD, and alterations in MEs may
      contribute to abnormalities in gut immunity and/or homeostasis in ASD children.
      Further study of the MEs identified here may advance our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of ASD.

AB  - Metagenomic analyses indicate that streptococcus gallolyticus is enriched at
      carcinoma in colitis associated colorectal cancer compared with sporadic
      colorectal cancer. But the particular mechanism of streptococcus gallolyticus in 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease malignant progression remains undefined yet. We aim to
      explore the biological carcinogenesis efficacy of streptococcus gallolyticus and 
      its potential mechanism in azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate-induced
      colitis associated colorectal cancer in mice. Oral pretreatment of streptococcus 
      gallolyticus was adopted to evaluate its detrimental effect. The colorectums of
      experimental C57BL/6 mice were collected and examined for the degree of
      tumorigenesis. Comparative 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out to observe
      streptococcus gallolyticus alterations in abundance. We found that streptococcus 
      gallolyticus are enriched in colonic carcinoma compared to adenoma and healthy
      mice. Pretreatment of Streptococcus gallolyticus aggravated tumor formation, with
      more colonic obstruction, larger number and diameter of tumor node. Furthermore, 
      Streptococcus gallolyticus selectively recruits tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells 
      but not mast cells, including marrow-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated
      macrophages and dendritic cells, which can inhibit competence of T cells.
      Moreover, several myeloid-cell-derived proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta,
      IL-8, CCL2, COX-2, TNF-alpha) were increased with the formation of carcinoma in
      IBD. Collectively, these data suggest that, through recruitment of
      tumor-infiltrating immune cells, Streptococcus gallolyticus generate an immune
      suppressive microenvironment that is conducive for neoplasia progression of
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - The mammalian gut has a remarkable abundance of microbes. These microbes have
      strong potential to biosynthesize distinct metabolites that are promising drugs, 
      and many more bioactive compounds have yet to be explored as potential drug
      candidates. These small bioactive molecules often mediate important host-microbe 
      and microbe-microbe interactions. In this review, we provide perspectives on and 
      challenges associated with three mining strategies - culture-based,
      (meta)genomics-based, and metabolomics-based mining approaches - for discovering 
      natural products derived from biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in mammalian gut 
      microbiota. In addition, we comprehensively summarize the structures, biological 
      functions, and BGCs of these compounds. Improving these techniques, including by 
      using combinatorial approaches, may accelerate drug discovery from gut microbes.

AB  - The human microbiome is our "other genome." Implicated in a growing list of
      complex diseases, for which genomic studies typically explain a portion of the
      disease susceptibility, the human gut microbiome has been at the spotlight for
      our understanding of human diseases. As the microbiome is intrinsically more
      variable than the human genome, it is important to take careful considerations at
      each step of a study. Here, we put forward our recommendations, which we envision
      would facilitate identification of true drug targets in the human microbiome in
      the colon as well as at other body sites.

PG  - 399
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2431-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the analysis of a large number of metagenomic sequences costs
      heavy computing resources and takes long time, we examined a selected small part 
      of metagenomic sequences as "sample"s of the entire full sequences, both for a
      mock community and for 10 different existing metagenomics case studies. A mock
      community with 10 bacterial strains was prepared, and their mixed genome were
      sequenced by Hiseq. The hits of BLAST search for reference genome of each strain 
      were counted. Each of 176 different small parts selected from these sequences
      were also searched by BLAST and their hits were also counted, in order to compare
      them to the original search results from the full sequences. We also prepared
      small parts of sequences which were selected from 10 publicly downloadable
      research data of MG-RAST service, and analyzed these samples with MG-RAST.
      RESULTS: Both the BLAST search tests of the mock community and the results from
      the publicly downloadable researches of MG-RAST show that sampling an extremely
      small part from sequence data is useful to estimate brief taxonomic information
      of the original metagenomic sequences. For 9 cases out of 10, the most annotated 
      classes from the MG-RAST analyses of the selected partial sample sequences are
      the same as the ones from the originals. CONCLUSIONS: When a researcher wants to 
      estimate brief information of a metagenome's taxonomic distribution with less
      computing resources and within shorter time, the researcher can analyze a
      selected small part of metagenomic sequences. With this approach, we can also
      build a strategy to monitor metagenome samples of wider geographic area, more
      frequently.

TI  - Shaping microbial consortia in coupling glycerol fermentation and carboxylate
      chain elongation for Co-production of 1,3-propanediol and caproate: Pathways and 
      mechanisms.
PG  - 281-291

AB  - Glycerol is presently being generated in surplus with the rapid growth of the
      biodiesel industry and seeks ways to be upcycled, rather than to be treated with 
      costs. Glycerol for the co-production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and caproate
      has a great prospect. Yet, its technical difficulty lies in the enhancement of
      caproate productivity, which requires the presence of ethanol as a co-substrate
      and necessitates the co-existence of functional microbes for glycerol
      fermentation and chain elongation. This study successfully achieved 6.38mMC
      1,3-PDO d(-1) and 2.95mMC caproate d(-1) in a 2-L mixed-cultured semi-continuous 
      fermenter with a glycerol-ethanol-acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4:3:1. Such
      conversions were mainly facilitated by a microbial community of Eubacterium
      limosum, Clostridium kluyveri and Massilibacterium senegalense. With such a
      synergistic microbiome, the co-production of 1,3-PDO and caproate was achieved
      from glycerol without ethanol addition. Based on metagenomics, E. limosum is
      capable of converting glycerol to 1,3-PDO, ethanol and H2, and also redirecting
      the electron potential of H2 into acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which
      is then used for chain elongation. C. kluyveri worked synergistically with E.
      limosum by consuming ethanol and acetate for caproate production. M. senegalense 
      encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate, facilitating the
      generation of these intermediates for C. kluyveri elongation to caproate. During 
      the transition between fermentation and elongation, an unexpected observation of 
      poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) formation and reutilization by M. senegalense may
      be associated with butyrate formation for further caproate generation. The
      knowledge gleaned from the substrate constitute, microbial consortium and their
      synergetic metabolism demonstrates a resource upgrade potential for crude
      glycerol or glycerol-containing wastewater generated from the biodiesel industry.

TI  - Combining morpho-taxonomy and metabarcoding enhances the detection of
      non-indigenous marine pests in biofouling communities.

AB  - Marine infrastructure can favor the spread of non-indigenous marine biofouling
      species by providing a suitable habitat for them to proliferate. Cryptic
      organisms or those in early life stages can be difficult to distinguish by
      conventional morphological taxonomy. Molecular tools, such as metabarcoding, may 
      improve their detection. In this study, the ability of morpho-taxonomy and
      metabarcoding (18S rRNA and COI) using three reference databases (PR2, BOLD and
      NCBI) to characterize biodiversity and detect non-indigenous species (NIS) in
      biofouling was compared on 60 passive samplers deployed over summer and winter in
      a New Zealand marina. Highest resolution of metazoan taxa was identified using
      18S rRNA assigned to PR2. There were higher assignment rates to NCBI reference
      sequences, but poorer taxonomic identification. Using all methods, 48 potential
      NIS were identified. Metabarcoding detected the largest proportion of those NIS: 
      77% via 18S rRNA/PR2 and NCBI and 35% via COI/BOLD and NCBI. Morpho-taxonomy
      detected an additional 14% of all identified NIS comprising mainly of bryozoan
      taxa. The data highlight several on-going challenges, including: differential
      marker resolution, primer biases, incomplete sequence reference databases, and
      variations in bioinformatic pipelines. Combining morpho-taxonomy and molecular
      analysis methods will likely enhance the detection of NIS from complex
      biofouling.

AB  - Denitrifying sulfur conversion-associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal
      (DS-EBPR) system is not only a novel wastewater treatment process, but also an
      ideal model for microbial ecology in a community context. However, it exists the 
      knowledge gap on the roles and interactions of functional microorganisms in the
      DS-EBPR system for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S)
      bioconversions. We use genome-resolved metagenomics to build up an ecological
      model of microbial communities in a lab-scale DS-EBPR system with stable
      operation for more than 400 days. Our results yield 11 near-complete draft
      genomes that represent a substantial portion of the microbial community (39.4%). 
      Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) promote
      complex metabolic processes and interactions for C, N, P and S conversions. Bins 
      1-4 and 10 are considered as new potential polyphosphate-accumulating organisms
      (PAOs), in which Bins 1-4 can be considered as S-related PAOs (S-PAOs) with no
      previously cultivated or reported members. Our findings give an insight into a
      new ecological system with C, N, P and S simultaneous bioconversions and improve 
      the understanding of interactions among SRB, SOB, denitrifiers and PAOs within a 
      community context.
